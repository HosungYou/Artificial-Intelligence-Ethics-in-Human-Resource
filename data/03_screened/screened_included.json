    "abstract": "An organization's long-term success is primarily tied to employee performance, creating a mutually beneficial relationship. High-performance employees drive organizational excellence, whereas effective organizations foster employee growth and development. Strategic compensation and benefit management enable employee performance by fostering trust, well-being, and engagement. This productivity gain translates to a sustainable competitive advantage, as high-performance and engaged human resources consistently deliver superior outcomes and innovations. Therefore, this study proposes an innovative Big Data Analytics (BDA)-enabled Organizational Performance Optimization (OPO) framework for compensation and benefit management. Integrating two technological models\u2013Big Data Enabled Decision Support Architecture (BD-DSA) for secure beneficiary verification, and Contextual Recurrent-Value Learning Unit Gated Recurring Unit (CR-VLU-GRU) for accurate pay-grade classification\u2013this framework addresses critical gaps in Human Resource (HR) decision-making. To balance operational efficiency and employee trust, this study incorporates data privacy-preserving techniques and efficient structuring into the model. The findings of the study show significant improvements in the proposed model when compared with the existing models, with \u2013 50 % faster data retrieval for employee queries, 70 % reduction in employee digital signature creation and verification time, and 99 % accuracy and fairness in compensation allocation based on pay-grade classifications. The study highlights how data-driven compensation and benefit management strategies directly contribute to employee performance, reducing employee turnover, and eventually boosting the productivity and performance of the organization. Limitations and future direction discussions indicate that the integration of corporate social responsibility dimensions and cross-sectoral validations would strengthen the proposed framework to broaden generalizability. \u00a9 2025 The Author(s)",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) holds transformative potential for human resources (HR), yet its adoption remains limited, particularly within the broader context of digital transformation (DT). Although trust is widely recognised as a critical enabler of AI adoption, little is known about the organisational conditions under which this trust develops, especially in firms with low digital maturity. This study investigates how configurations of organisational factors, namely technology, digital skills, culture supporting DT and HR\u2019s involvement in DT initiatives, can shape trust in AI adoption within HR practices. The methodological approach followed two steps: (1) the questionnaire design was validated through insights derived from interviews conducted during a case study analysis, and (2) a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis using survey data was employed. The findings contribute to shedding light on trust enablers and hindering factors that positively influence AI adoption in HR practices. Results show that trust can emerge even in digitally less mature firms when HR functions are strategically involved in broader DT initiatives. Conversely, HR digital skills and functional involvement together with cultural readiness can foster trust independently without top-down managerial involvement. These findings challenge conventional assumptions that digital maturity and leadership engagement are conditions for fostering trust in the adoption of new technologies. By uncovering multiple pathways to trust, this study contributes theoretically by framing trust as a configurational, organisational-level outcome. This work aims to advance the discourse on technological innovation in HR, providing valuable insights for practitioners and scholars to support digitally lagging organisations navigating the challenges of AI adoption. \u00a9 \u00a9 2025.

    "abstract": "Personnel recruitment is increasingly mediated by Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS), which rank candidates for job positions, making them a central decision-support tool in modern Human Resources (HR) processes. Often framed as an information retrieval (IR) problem, the ranking of candidates in ATS is typically driven by relevance to the job position, with algorithms sorting applicants according to a set of predefined criteria. In recent years, fairness-aware ranking methods have emerged to mitigate the risk of indirect discrimination, where the ordering of candidates may inadvertently favor one demographic group over another. These approaches are inspired by browsing models developed for web search and aim to balance candidate exposure based on protected characteristics. However, ATS in recruitment introduce unique challenges due to their high-stakes nature and the decision-making context in which they operate. In this paper, we present a series of user studies that explore the disconnect between fair exposure and fair outcomes in candidate shortlisting. We focus on how factors such as task design (e.g., how recruiters interact with candidate lists), individual representations of candidates (e.g., national origin cues), and ranking order influence both position bias and demographic balance. Our findings show that while demographic balance may be achieved in terms of ranking visibility, this does not necessarily translate to fair outcomes in terms of who gets shortlisted. Through a crowdsourced experiment and in-depth interviews with recruiters, we identify key task-level, individual, and ranking factors that mediate these effects. We conclude that fairness in ATS rankings is contingent not only on algorithmic design but also on the shortlisting tasks they support, as well as the interfaces, strategies, and assumptions that recruiters use when interacting with candidate lists. Based on these insights, we provide implications for the design of algorithms, interfaces, and recruitment processes that support fairer and more equitable recruitment outcomes. \u00a9 2025 The Author(s).

    "abstract": "The goal of uplift modeling is to recommend actions that optimize specific outcomes by determining which entities should receive treatment.One common approach involves two steps: first, an inference step that estimates conditional average treatment effects (CATEs), and second, an optimization step that ranks entities based on their CATE values and assigns treatment to the top k within a given budget. While uplift modeling typically focuses on binary treatments, many real-world applications are characterized by continuous-valued treatments, i.e., a treatment dose. This paper presents a predict-then-optimize framework for uplift modeling with continuous treatments. First, in the inference step, conditional average dose responses (CADRs) are estimated from data using causal machine learning techniques. Second, in the optimization step, we frame the assignment task of continuous treatments as a dose-allocation problem and solve it using integer linear programming (ILP). This approach allows decision-makers to efficiently and effectively allocate treatment doses while balancing resource availability, with the possibility of adding extra constraints like fairness considerations or adapting the objective function to take into account instance-dependent costs and benefits to maximize utility. The experiments compare several CADR estimators and illustrate the trade-offs between policy value and fairness, as well as the impact of an adapted objective function. This demonstrates the framework's advantages and flexibility across diverse applications in healthcare, lending, and human resource management.

Drawing on conservation of resources theory and social learning theory, this study examines how responsible AI enhances employees' service innovation behavior via employee AI self-efficacy and employee AI crafting, with a particular focus on the moderating role of leader AI crafting. We tested the proposed relationships using structural equation modeling with data collected from 335 U.S. employees working in various service organizations. The findings demonstrate that the indirect effect of responsible AI on employee service innovation behavior is mediated serially by employee AI self-efficacy and employee AI crafting. Furthermore, leader AI crafting strengthens the positive relationship between responsible AI and employee AI self-efficacy. This study contributes to the AI and management literature by highlighting the importance of responsible AI systems in promoting service innovation behavior among employees.

    "abstract": "The accelerated adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in hiring is prompting questions about how national institutions and policy initiatives shape societal acceptance of AI-driven selection tools. In South Korea, a state-led push for fair hiring, via blind recruitment, coexists uneasily with employers\u2019 drive for efficiency amid high applicant pools. Drawing on institutional complexity and technology governance perspectives, we examine how government-driven fairness logic and firm-level efficiency logic jointly influence AI recruitment adoption. Applying Kaplan\u2013Meier estimation and Cox proportional hazards models to an unbalanced panel dataset (111 firms, 449 firm-year observations, 2018\u20132022) constructed by integrating publicly available firm-level panel data with survey responses from HR managers, we find that organizations adopting blind recruitment (fairness logic) are significantly more likely to implement AI hiring systems. Likewise, firms experiencing higher applicant-to-hire competition (efficiency logic) also adopt AI more frequently. However, the interaction effect between fairness and efficiency logics is not statistically significant, suggesting incomplete alignment between policy-led fairness objectives and organizational efficiency demands. Our findings highlight how socio-technical contexts guide the path of AI technology diffusion in recruitment: in particular, state-led policy reforms, cultural discourses on fairness, and large-scale applicant competition. We discuss implications for technology governance, institutional actors\u2019 roles, and the balancing act between fairness and efficiency in digital hiring practices. \u00a9 2025 Elsevier Ltd.",

    "abstract": "It is well established that combining information via a simple algorithm (mechanical combination) results in better hiring decisions than a holistic combination. Nevertheless, mechanical combination is perceived negatively and rarely used in practice. Transparency is an often-mentioned determinant of algorithmic trust in the AI-literature, but has hardly received attention regarding mechanical judgment. Therefore, in four studies (total N = 1205), we experimentally investigated the effect of various operationalizations of transparency on the perceptions of simple, mechanical algorithmic hiring procedures among decision-makers and applicants. Quantitative analyses were supplemented with thematic analyses of open-ended responses. The original between-subjects studies hardly showed differences between conditions, but open question responses indicated that this may have been due to an emphasis on \u201cfiller information.\u201d Subsequent within-subjects studies did show the expected positive effects of transparency, but mostly with small effect sizes. However, both applicants and decision-makers indicated a strong preference for transparent algorithms over opaque algorithms and over holistic judgment when asked to choose directly. Moreover, unexpectedly, compared to holistic judgment, the applicant sample showed more positive perceptions, even for an opaque algorithm. Open question responses suggest that both groups generally perceived algorithms as fairer, but not more valid than holistic judgment, but the quantitative results did not fully support that pattern. In addition, the open responses suggest that while transparency is requested when not provided, it may also evoke more scrutiny when it is, which may not necessarily affect perceptions positively. \u00a9 2026 The Author(s).

    "abstract": "What are the implications of the growing use of artificial intelligence (AI) in recruitment and hiring for organizational inequalities? While advocates suggest that AI is a groundbreaking tool that can enhance hiring precision, efficiency, diversity and fit, critics raise serious concerns around bias, fairness, and privacy. This review article critically advances this debate by drawing on diverse scholarship across computing and data sciences; human resource, management, and organization studies; social sciences; and law. Using a hybrid review approach that combines scoping and problematizing review methods, we examine the implications of algorithmic hiring for organizational inequalities. Our review identifies a multidisciplinary discussion marked by asymmetries in how key concerns are conceptualized; a clear and heightened potential for AI to conceal inequalities in hiring processes; and contestation over the regulation of algorithmic hiring. Building on Acker\u2019s (2006) framework of \u2018inequality regimes\u2019, we propose the concept of algorithmically-mediated inequality regimes to highlight AI\u2019s capacity for concealing and reproducing inequalities in hiring through enhanced algorithmic invisibility and the growing legitimacy of AI solutions. We propose an agenda for future research, policy, and practice, emphasizing the need for an interdisciplinary \u2018chain of knowledge\u2019 and a multi-stakeholder \u2018chain of responsibility\u2019 in AI application and regulation. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2025.

In view of its pluralistic approach to human morality, we adopt Moral Foundations Theory (MFT) as our theoretical lens through which to study reactions to AI-led decision-making in selection. Using a qualitative approach, we explore individuals' reactions to the idea of AI-evaluated interviews, mapping these reactions onto moral foundations, identifying novel sub-themes specific to the context of AI in selection. Using 33 interviews with working adults, we find that all six moral foundations - care, fairness, authority, loyalty, sanctity, and liberty - are evoked when discussing the implementation of AI in selection. We discuss how these moral foundations manifest themselves in this AI decision making context, and articulate theoretical and practical implications. \u00a9 2025 The Author(s).

Using data collected from 532 employees through an online survey, the relationships among constructs were analyzed using PLS-SEM. Results reveal that trust in AI exerts a positive and significant influence on employee\u2013AI collaboration, while threat perception indirectly affects collaboration through motivational pathways. Furthermore, protean career orientation positively moderates the link between AI trust and collaboration, indicating that self-directed career attitudes strengthen adaptive engagement with AI systems. These findings underscore that approach and avoidance motivation play distinct roles in shaping collaboration outcomes, which in turn enhance various facets of career sustainability. The study contributes to theory by integrating cognitive appraisal and motivation perspectives to explain human\u2013AI dynamics and provides managerial implications for fostering effective AI integration and sustainable career development in the digital workplace. \u00a9 2025 The Author(s)",

We extend this concept by proposing a novel approach to quantification which leverages Holland\u2019s theory of occupational interests to provide a more holistic interpretation of discrimination in these systems. Building upon the seminal work of Bertrand and Mullainathan (Am Econ Rev 94(4):991\u20131013, 2004), which examined racial discrimination in hiring through a naturalistic experiment, we adapt their methodology to explore biases embedded in AI-driven job recommendations. By manipulating gender and race within user profiles, as well as investigating if these characteristics are inferred by name alone, we assess the extent to which conversational AI models (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Llama 2, and Gemini) exhibit discriminatory patterns. Our findings indicate significant disparities in job recommendations based on demographic factors. These findings vary between AI models. We extend previous research in this domain which explores bias with singular metrics by transforming recommendations via Holland\u2019s theory to a multidimensional set of characteristics allowing for a more thorough interpretation of bias. Our work underscores the importance of continuous auditing and refinement of AI systems to mitigate bias and promote fairness in automated decision-making processes. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2025.",

A quantitative approach was utilized, and structured surveys were distributed to HR experts and HR managers who work in different industrial sectors in Jordan. Data from 415 valid respondents were statistically analyzed rigorously using the statistical software SPSS and AMOS, and were able to identify direct effects and moderation pathways. The study proves that operational efficiency in HR advances substantially by using data analytical systems with AI and cloud-based platforms. The quality of the data obtained acts as the fundamental element connecting organizational success. Organizations can fully benefit from digital transformation with proper data governance and consistent human resource data, but the absence or incorrect management blocks their advantages. Organizations should adopt digital technology as it depends on producing quality HR information to maximize HR efficiency. Jordanian businesses should invest in AI ethics, data governance, and cloud security measures to obtain the full advantages of digital transformation in HRM. The study presents applicable guidance for HR professionals, management executives, and governmental policymakers. \u00a9 The Author 2026. Published by ARDA.

    "abstract": "Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems have become mission-critical infrastructures, integrating finance, human resources, supply chains, manufacturing, and customer management. The increasing integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into these platforms promises efficiency and strategic value, yet it also raises acute ethical and governance challenges: bias in recruitment, opaque decision logic in resource allocation, privacy and data protection risks, accountability gaps, and environmental costs from computational intensity. Although governments and scholars have proposed principles and regulatory frameworks - such as Floridi and Cowls' unified five principles, the U.S. NIST AI Risk Management Framework (RMF), and the European Union's AI Act - there remains limited scrutiny of industry-developed frameworks that directly guide enterprise practice. This paper addresses that gap through a critical case study of the SAP AI Ethics framework, which articulates nine principles, a risk assessment process, and a five phase lifecycle for AI within ERP systems. We evaluate its provisions against the EAGLE ERP governance framework, the NIST AI RMF, and Floridi and Cowls' principled framework, identifying areas of alignment, divergence, and under specification. We further situate the framework within ongoing regulatory debates, engaging critiques of the EU AI Act concerning risk standardization, categorization, reliance on private and challenges of enforcement. Our contributions are fourfold: (1) a transparent document analysis of SAP's ethics framework; (2) a comparative mapping to academic and policy frameworks; (3) a critical assessment of governance, accountability, and ethical trade-offs in ERP deployments; and (4) evidence-informed recommendations - including independent oversight, risk registers, transparency artifacts, participatory design, and sustainability metrics - illustrated through ERP-specific vignettes in human capital, procurement, finance, and planning. The paper demonstrates how enterprises can translate high-level AI ethics into operational governance, offering actionable guidance for both scholars and practitioners. \u00a9 1973-2011 IEEE.",

This paper contains a hypothesis and a proven Artificial Intelligence-based Decision Intelligences Model to combine cyber risk-conscious quality systems with transparent, equitable, and responsible HR decision-making. The model includes explainability layers based on SHAP, rule-based inference to facilitate understandability among the people responsible in quality engineering, cybersecurity experts, and HR managers. The structural associations between Explainable AI (XAI) capabilities, cyber risk-conscious quality performance, and ethical HR decision-making are examined using an empirical study of organisations that are undergoing digital transformation. The Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) moderating effect is reviewed to identify whether the cultures with socially responsible practises can enhance the influence of the XAIenabled governance on the sustainable performance of an organisation. Structural equation modelling (SEM) validates that XAI highly enhances the accuracy of decision making, risk transparency and ethical adherence in the quality and HR departments. The CSR is revealed to strengthen both the direct and mediated relationships proving its contribution to the reinforced belief, fairness, and long-term sustainability. The research adds a tested framework, a multilayer clarification framework, and an expert manual of action to cut transparent AI-driven governance systems in the digital enterprises. \u00a9 2026, SRAC-Romanian Society for Quality.

Drawing on positive communication scholarship (Mirivel & Fuller, 2024) and the Human Needs Approach (Socha & Beck, 2015), we explore how AI-generated job descriptions shape anticipatory socialization and perceptions of workplace culture. Using qualitative focus groups, we identify key themes related to authenticity, engagement, and the fulfillment of fundamental psychological needs. Findings indicate that although positive communication enhances job attractiveness, job seekers remain skeptical of AI-generated content unless it aligns with real-world workplace values. Organizations must balance AI efficiency with human oversight to maintain trust and ensure transparency in recruitment messaging. This study contributes to business communication research by offering practical and pedagogical implications for AI-integrated hiring strategies and ethical recruitment communication. \u00a9 2026 by the Association for Business Communication",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly promoted to practitioners as tools for inferring personality traits from LinkedIn profiles, promising scalable and innovative assessments. Yet, the psychometric foundations of such inferences remain untested. Building on the lens model, we presented 406 LinkedIn profiles to Microsoft Copilot (powered by GPT-4) twice, using single-shot prompting to assess personality (Big Five, narcissism) and intelligence. Inferences showed satisfactory intra-rater reliability for observable traits (up to r =.81), but poor reliability for less visible traits, suggesting unstable inferences (as low as r =.31). Correlations with ground-truth test scores indicate above-chance yet limited convergent validity for intelligence (r =.24), openness (r =.20), and extraversion (r =.20), but not for less visible traits. Analysis of 32 coded LinkedIn cues suggests that this above-chance convergence reflects Copilot drawing on LinkedIn information with some consistency and sensitivity to valid trait signals. While this suggests a rudimentary functional grasp of personality, inferences were undermined by serious flaws, including positivity bias, range restriction, poor discriminant validity, cue overgeneralization, and adverse demographic impacts. By extending the lens model to LLMs as perceivers, we offer a theoretical and empirical foundation for understanding LLM-based trait inferences. Overall, claims that LLMs can validly infer personality from LinkedIn profiles are not just overoptimistic, but potentially harmful\u2014they risk encouraging the adoption of practices that could lead to invalid selection decisions, unfair treatment of applicants, and legal exposure for organizations. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2026.",

This chapter examines how artificial intelligence (AI) may transform organizational approaches to diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging (DEIB) by enhancing procedural justice and addressing unconscious biases. We developed a sociotechnical framework that integrates justice theories, critical perspectives, and psychological approaches to navigate the promise and paradox of AI in DEIB contexts. Although AI systems offer consistency in evaluation and pattern recognition at scale, they risk perpetuating historical biases and marginalization, operating with limited transparency, and reducing complex social phenomena to oversimplified metrics. Our framework presents a cyclical approach with four interconnected domains: value-driven design and data; sociotechnical implementation; governance and critical safeguards; and evaluative feedback. We analyze strategic applications across the employee lifecycle, from mitigating recruitment bias to enhancing equity in advancement and fostering inclusive communication. Through organizational case studies, we demonstrate how thoughtfully implemented AI can meaningfully enhance workplace equity while avoiding technological solutionism. This research contributes to emerging literature on algorithmic fairness and organizational justice. \u00a9 2026 selection and editorial matter, Arif Perdana, Vijayakumar Bharathi S., Kanchan Patil, Grace Wangge, Sabina Satriyani Puspita and Wei Kang; individual chapters, the contributors.",

With the increasing availability of large datasets and advanced analytics tools, organizations can gain valuable insights into workforce demographics, identify disparities, and design targeted strategies to address inequalities. Big data enables tracking of gender representation in hiring, promotions, and leadership roles, offering a clearer picture of progress toward diversity goals. The study highlights the potential of big data to uncover unconscious biases, analyze wage gaps, and assess the effectiveness of inclusion policies. By utilizing predictive analytics, organizations can forecast trends and develop proactive measures to foster equitable opportunities. Moreover, the integration of big data in decision-making promotes transparency, accountability, and a data-driven approach to achieving gender parity. While big data offers significant potential, the chapter also discusses challenges such as data privacy, ethical concerns, and the risk of misinterpreting data. The findings emphasize the need for responsible data governance and collaboration among stakeholders to maximize the benefits of big data in advancing diversity and inclusion. Ultimately, the research underscores the critical role of data-driven insights in creating fair and inclusive environments, contributing to sustainable growth and social equity. \u00a9 2026 by Apple Academic Press, Inc.",

Promises to get rid of tedious tasks at work and improve productivity are weighed against fears of job displacement and too fast an automation pace. The current research employs a mixed-methods methodology by conducting qualitative research on labor laws, policies, and ethical frameworks in AI, along with quantitative data that will be generated through surveys and interviews of stakeholders in the labor market in Jordan. After tracing the existing governance model and understanding how AI impacts labor relations, the study will develop a proportionate framework addressing ethics, regulation, and social impacts related to AI adoption.

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming human resource management (HRM), introducing new efficiencies in recruitment, evaluation, and decision-making. However, its effect on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) remains debated. This systematic literature review (SLR) compiles findings from 43 peer-reviewed articles published between 2016 and 2024 to critically assess AI\u2019s dual role in HRM as both a potential promoter of fairness and a source of embedded bias. Rooted in ethical principles like fairness and accountability, organizational viewpoints such as HRM implementation challenges and best practices, and technological factors including algorithmic transparency and data quality, this review highlights four main themes: (1) AI\u2019s ability to improve standardization, objectivity, and accessibility in HR processes; (2) risks related to algorithms and data that could perpetuate systemic bias and lessen accountability; (3) the human, data, and algorithmic origins of these issues; and (4) strategies for mitigation including participatory design, explainability, human oversight, and ethical governance. Despite growing interest in AI integration within HRM, previous studies have mostly treated fairness and effectiveness as separate issues, providing limited insight into how AI simultaneously impacts DEI outcomes. Additionally, the current literature often neglects the practical difficulties of implementing ethical principles, leaving HR professionals with scattered guidance. This review addresses these gaps by providing a timely, interdisciplinary overview that connects academic discussions with the urgent need for ethically responsible AI use in real-world HR environments. Practical implications are provided for HR professionals, developers, and organizational leaders, highlighting the importance of transparent implementation and inclusive design. Additionally, the review highlights theoretical and methodological gaps, suggesting that future research should focus on employee perceptions, contextual moderators, and the long-term effects of AI in various organizational settings. By presenting a comprehensive, multidisciplinary synthesis, this study advances the ongoing discussion on the ethical integration of AI in HRM. It provides practical guidance on aligning technological progress with inclusive organizational values. JEL Codes: M12; O33; J71; M14 \u00a9 The Author(s) 2026.",

The purpose of this study is to measure the value of an automated performance management system in public sector organisations and to identify which components of the system create more value. For this, 3,680 employees of public sector organisations in Latvia are surveyed. The results prove that respondents perceive the positive value of the performance management system for both: employees and organisations. Results of hierarchical regression analysis show that the information technology tool, fairness, and constructive feedback are the core value creating elements. This study offers empirical evidence on the value of an automated performance management system in public sector organisations and identifies the role of line managers in the successful implementation of the performance management system. \u00a9 \u00a9 2026 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",

In three between-subject experiments, we exposed managers to vignettes describing an AI or human norm violation during the hiring process. The results show a bright side of AI arising from the finding that managers might be more ethical when sharing HR tasks with algorithms than with other people in organizations because working with AI limits assigning responsibility to other humans.

This study applies the Socio-Technical Systems (STS) perspective to analyze how Human Resource Management (HRM) must evolve to serve as a strategic enabler in this transition. A scoping review of 88 peer-reviewed papers was conducted and analyzed through structured content analysis, resulting in five macro-groups and 14 critical HRM groups/themes mapped across the four STS elements: structure, people, tasks, and physical systems. The results highlight practices related to AI-assisted recruitment, workforce retraining, symbiotic integration between people and smart robots, and new models of collaboration. Among the challenges identified are the need for continuous training, organizational adaptability, ethical concerns, and strategic alignment of digital technology adoption. These findings consolidate the structure of HRM 5.0-STS, which integrates the social and technical subsystems of HRM in Industry 5.0 manufacturing contexts. The framework offers actionable insights for managers, policymakers, leaders, and the workforce itself in redesigning and aligning human capabilities with advanced digital technologies, reinforcing human-centered resilience and sustainability in the intelligent manufacturing system. \u00a9 2025 Elsevier Ltd",

Given HRD\u2019s reliance on non-experimental research, robust secondary data analysis is critical for enhancing evidence quality. Yet, manual data extraction remains a laborious, error-prone, barrier to scalability. An international panel of HRD experts (n = 26) engaged in iterative rounds of this mixed-method Delphi study exploring AI-supported data extraction in HRD research. Quantitative analysis followed Delphi protocols with pre-defined thresholds, and qualitative analysis included k-means clustering, thematic analysis, and sentiment analysis. The study pursued three objectives: (1) identify critical data elements and reporting structures for building a reliable HRD evidence base; (2) assess existing tools and define features of an ideal AI-assisted extraction tool; and (3) examine contextual factors that facilitate or hinder automation, ensuring applicability across diverse research settings. Findings revealed technological, disciplinary, and governance challenges. Experts prioritized methodological details (e.g., sample size, inclusion criteria) and expressed divergent views on tabular extraction. Concerns around bias, transparency, and ethics underscore the need for responsible AI stewardship. Key opportunities include bridging skill gaps, standardizing governance, and fostering interdisciplinary collaboration. HRD is uniquely positioned to shape ethical AI adoption and safeguard research quality. \u00a9 2025 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

At the same time, privacy computing methods, within federated learning at secure multi-party computation, ensure that sensitive personal information is protected during data processing analysis. The proposed platform thus achieves a balance between data utility at privacy protection, providing HR managers with accurate, real-time decision support while complying with data security regulations.

    "abstract": "In this paper, I investigate how discourse on Reddit\u2019s/r/antiwork subreddit reflects emerging forms of labor refusal, symbolic resistance, and critiques of contemporary work ideology. \u201cAntiworkers\u201d frequently complain about gig and precarious employment, where lack of autonomy and meaningless tasks lead directly to shared feelings of estrangement and dissatisfaction. Examples include recurrent discussions around artificial intelligence-screened job applications rejecting qualified candidates without human oversight, as workers are not only removed from meaningful engagement but actively dehumanized by automated hiring processes. I analyze a dataset of over 38,000 posts and comments spanning 2021 to 2023 using computational methods \u2014 including sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and network mapping \u2014 to trace patterns of dissatisfaction related to economic precarity, burnout, and structural inequality. I approach this analysis through a research ethics framework that treats Reddit data not as neutral, but as politically charged and shaped by the platform itself, drawing on insights from critical data studies. Through a synthesis of autonomist Marxism, feminist political economy, and critical media theory, I demonstrate how/r/antiwork functions as a discursive site of refusal where users contest the moral and affective centrality of work. Rather than dismissing the subreddit as merely cathartic or performative, I argue that its rhetorical practices constitute a digitally mediated form of collective dissent. These findings contribute to ongoing debates about the efficacy of digital activism, highlighting how symbolic resistance and discursive solidarity operate as meaningful forms of political engagement under contemporary conditions of labor alienation. \u00a9 2025, First Monday.

    "abstract": "The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into career guidance systems presents a valuable opportunity to address the structural, informational, and psychological barriers that hinder effective decision-making for university students. This study outlines the development and implementation of a user-centred, AI-driven career guidance framework tailored for South African higher education institutions. Grounded in behavioural theory, particularly Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT), the framework was crafted using a qualitative research approach that incorporated insights from students\u2019 focus group discussions and semi-structured interviews with lecturers. Findings show that students value personalised, context-sensitive guidance features, particularly those that link academic achievements to job market trends. Educators emphasised the need for system transparency, data security, and fair access to build trust and promote adoption. Results indicate AI-powered tools can boost students' confidence and career self-efficacy when integrated into academic support frameworks. The study highlights key contextual factors influencing career decision-making, such as the availability of reliable information, self-efficacy, the perceived usefulness of AI tools, and the digital readiness of institutions. The framework integrates machine learning profiling, personalised recommendations, and feedback loops, addresses inequalities, aligns education with labour-market needs, and helps students make career decisions. The evaluation findings show that stakeholders essentially embrace AI-powered guidance tools, though ongoing concerns include data privacy, confidence in the recommendations, and ensuring equal access. This paper offers a practical and theoretically informed model for career development interventions in developing contexts, serving as a blueprint for inclusive, scalable, and adaptable AI solutions in higher education. \u00a9 Authors.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: This study examines how chatbots, as part of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), can assist human resource (HR) professionals in supporting more effective knowledge management (KM), especially knowledge sharing (KS). The research aims to understand the strategic roles of chatbots in Human Resource Management (HRM). It offers propositions for their effective deployment to support KS and enhance their utilisation within organisations. Methodology: A systematic literature review (SLR) was carried out using the databases Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 16 relevant articles were selected for detailed analysis. Results: The findings show that chatbots can significantly enhance KS by automating HRM processes. They enable personalised training, offer continuous support, and promote employee performance, engagement, and innovation. Furthermore, chatbots assist HR professionals in focusing on strategic tasks by lowering administrative workload. Several challenges are also identified, including ethical concerns, privacy issues, data quality problems, reduced social interaction, and risks to creativity and critical thinking. Conclusion: Chatbots offer a transformative opportunity for HRM to enhance KS, organisational memory, and digital learning, thereby supporting competitive advantage in knowledge-intensive settings. \u00a9 2025 Sciendo.

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is extensively reshaping organizational practices and redefining talent acquisition by automating recruitment processes and improving efficiency in candidate selection. Despite the growing research in this domain, there is a gap in comprehensive bibliometric analyses that systematically examine this domain. Thus, the current study aims to comprehend the existing literature with specific strategies for data extraction and analyze the future scope of AI in talent acquisition. With 533 articles extracted from the Scopus database, the publication trends, key contributors, and intellectual structures have been explored. The bibliometric analysis shows that the US and India are the leading contributors to the research area. Co-occurrence network analysis identified four clusters: (i) AI in recruitment and HR practices (major cluster), (ii) advanced technologies such as machine learning, deep learning, and automation, (iii) ethical and social considerations, and (iv) strategic HRM aspects like decision-making and diversity. It shows the centrality of AI-enabled recruitment and its connection with technical, social, and strategic aspects, highlighting the interdisciplinary nature of the domain. Thematic mapping confirms that AI and recruitment are the central themes and specifies the need for interdisciplinary exploration to fully understand the strategic and ethical implications. The intellectual structure demonstrates a shift in research focus from technical applications to ethical and strategic considerations in AI-driven recruitment. In conclusion, the study provides a systematic overview and offers actionable insights for researchers, HR practitioners, and policymakers to make evidence-based strategies, identify emerging trends, and facilitate responsible and strategic AI adoption in recruitment processes. \u00a9 2025 The Author(s)",

    "abstract": "Discrimination is both an objective reality and a subjective perception. While firms increasingly use AI for decisions like hiring, little is known about how AI versus human decision-makers affect perceived discrimination. Across seven studies (N = 1757), AI decisions are consistently seen as less discriminatory than identical human decisions across various contexts of discrimination. Study 2 shows this is mediated by inferred intentions: AI is viewed as neutral, while humans are seen as selfish or malicious. Study 3 rules out perceived predictability as an alternative explanation. Studies 4 and 5 find that high-adaptivity algorithms further reduce perceived discrimination, again mediated by intentions. This paradoxically favourable perception of AI decisions masks underlying biases, complicating efforts to detect and address discrimination. These findings highlight the critical gap between perceived and actual fairness in AI-driven decisions, underscoring the need for transparency, rigorous auditing and effective governance mechanisms to align perceptions with objective equity. \u00a9 2025 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",

Drawing on feminist, critical-race, and disability-studies HCI, we propose a dual design paradigm: (1) Participatory design as epistemic and distributive justice, and (2) Adaptive fairness as a dynamic, user-configurable model governance logic. Each case is analysed using a structured traceability method that maps observed harms to violated principles and concrete design responses.

    "abstract": "Background: The English National Health Service (NHS) strives for a fair, diverse, and inclusive workplace, but Black and Minority Ethnic (BME) representation in senior leadership roles remains limited. To address this, a large multi-hospital acute NHS Trust introduced an inclusive recruitment programme, requiring ethnically and gender diverse interview panels and a letter to the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) explaining hiring manager\u2019s candidate choice. This generated large amount of valuable structured and free-text data, but manual analysis to derive actionable insights is challenging, limiting efforts to evaluate and improve such equality, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) recruitment initiatives. Methods: Using this routinely collected recruitment data from the programme between September 2021 to January 2024, we used natural language processing artificial intelligence techniques, triangulated with secondary data analysis, to evaluate the programme\u2019s effectiveness in increasing the number of BME appointees to senior leadership roles. Multivariate\u00a0logistic regression identified recruitment factors that influence the odds of BME candidates applying, being shortlisted or offered a role compared to white candidates. Topic and sentiment analysis revealed thematic trends and tone of candidate assessments, stratified by hiring manager and candidate characteristics. Normalised average interview scores were also compared by job grades and candidate characteristics. Results: The requirement for hiring managers to write a letter to the CEO explaining recruitment decisions raised the odds of a BME candidate being offered a role by 1.7 times [95% CI 1.2\u20132.3] compared to white candidates. However, white candidates still had higher overall odds of being offered senior roles. BME candidates scored lower in interviews, with BME women twice as likely (p < 0.05) to receive negative assessments compared to white women. Conclusions: The Letter to the CEO component of the inclusive recruitment programme increased BME representation in senior leadership roles, but inequities still persist in the recruitment process, reflecting national NHS recruitment trends. While the initiative marks progress, further strategies are needed to ensure equitable recruitment, career development, and retention. Artificial intelligence tools, such as natural language processing, provide effective methods to evaluate and enhance EDI recruitment initiatives by analysing routinely collected recruitment data to identify areas for improvement and establish best practices. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2025.",

The descriptive approach assessed participants\u2019 understanding of AI, its perceived benefits, challenges, and risks in HRM. The findings on the perceived benefits of AI in HRM show that increased efficiency, better decision-making, and cost reduction are the top advantages, while ease of use ranks the lowest. However, challenges such as lack of expertise, data privacy concerns, high costs, and resistance to change remain significant barriers. Most respondents strongly agree that AI enhances recruitment, training, performance management, and compliance, but concerns persist over bias, transparency, and emotional intelligence limitations in areas like employee relations and compensation. Additionally, results on risks of using AI on HRM indicate that high-risk components like Human Resource Information System (HRIS), Recruitment, Compensation, and Performance Management face serious concerns such as bias and implementation complexity. Moderate-risk areas like succession planning and compliance show manageable challenges, while low-risk components like health and safety and employee relations reflect minimal issues. Statistical analysis confirms significant associations between risk levels and several HRM components, especially HRIS and Recruitment (p < 0.01), highlighting the need for targeted interventions. The study emphasizes the need for public institutions to establish robust ethical frameworks, invest in capacity-building for HR practitioners, and ensure human oversight in AI-driven processes. By addressing these concerns, public institutions can mitigate risks, improve AI adoption, and optimize the potential of AI to enhance HR practices, offering a roadmap for equitable, effective, and ethical implementation of AI technologies in workforce management. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2025.",

    "abstract": "This study examines the impact of artificial intelligence (AI)-driven insights on sustainable Human Resource Management (HRM) performance in higher education institutions. It explores the mediating roles of HRM practices optimization and decision-making enhancement, as well as the moderating effects of organizational culture, AI adoption readiness, and ethical considerations. By incorporating innovative insights into artificial intelligence technologies, this research contributes to career and HRM literature by revealing how AI transforms workforce dynamics in academic institutions. Data was collected via a quantitative survey from 215 participants, including administrators, AI and data science experts, data analysts, human resource management professionals, institutional leaders, IT staff, and policymakers from higher education institutions in the UAE. Using non-probability quota sampling. Data analysis was conducted through descriptive statistics, t-tests, correlation analysis, and structural equation modeling (SEM) using Partial Least Squares SEM (PLS-SEM) in SmartPLS software. Findings confirm that AI-driven insights significantly enhance sustainable HRM performance. Both HRM practices optimization and decision-making enhancement mediate this relationship. While ethical considerations, organizational culture, and AI adoption readiness directly influence HRM sustainability, they do not significantly moderate AI\u2019s impact, suggesting that individual engagement with AI technologies plays a more pivotal role than broader organizational factors. This research uniquely integrates the Resource-Based View (RBV) and Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to examine AI adoption in HRM within higher education\u2014an area previously underexplored. It underscores the importance of HRM optimization and decision-making in maximizing AI\u2019s benefits. The findings offer strategic insights for higher education institutions seeking to enhance HRM sustainability through effective AI integration. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2025.",

    "abstract": "Over the years a very large number of classification methods have been developed, which are now being referred to as \u201cclassical machine learning\u201d. However, a noticeable gap remains in research linking unsupervised learning techniques with explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods. In this study, we address this gap by proposing a novel method to enhance the interpretability of unsupervised learning, particularly for textual data. We integrate XAI techniques with the Gustafson-Kessel (GK) fuzzy clustering algorithm to enhance the capture of semantic relationships in text, in particular, resumes for employment. Our approach leverages the light-weight Sentence-BERT model to generate contextual embeddings, that offer a deeper semantic understanding of resume data. These embeddings provide richer representations compared to traditional textual feature extraction methods. Similar resumes are clustered using the GK fuzzy clustering algorithm to identify common patterns across resumes. Subsequently, informative summaries are used for employment purposes, enhancing resume categorization and job matching. The GK algorithm, was chosen over others as it is especially effective at handling complex structures as compared to other clustering methods. In clustering practice, an evaluation of clustering quality is generally performed. In this work, we conduct statistical analysis, ablation studies, and assess performance using various clustering metrics. We also incorporate Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to interpret the cluster memberships of individual resumes, thereby enhancing the transparency and trustworthiness of the clustering process. Our approach, when applied correctly, provides potential employers with clear and interpretable insights into how resumes are grouped. We present results on a resume data set that were summarized by our proposed method. The effective and interpretable clustering is shown in comparison with other clustering methods. The outcome is expected to improve the processing efficiency of applicant profiles and is helpful to human resource management. \u00a9 2025 Elsevier B.V.",

This chapter examines challenges in AI-enhanced HR concerning bias mitigation, data protection, transparency and governance through literature review, and real-life examples. Through a mixture of academic research and industry use cases including Amazon's AI hiring tool, HireVue video interview analysis, IBM Watson Career Coach and Unilever recruitment powered through AI study analyses AI impact on HR functions and approaches to address ethical concerns. This research offers an advanced methodological framework for ethical implementation of AI in HR which is based upon eight foundational components including interdisciplinary collaboration, bias minimisation, transparency and explainability, ethics-based privacy policies governance, continuous monitoring improving engagement with stakeholders, and adaptive trust-enhancing policy. The model weights a set of quantitative suggestion, new metrics such as Team Integration Score (TIS) for assessing cross-functional relationship success. Synthesis of multiple academic sources and case studies mentioned the chapter plan on responsible AI implementation in HR through stakeholder engagement, transparency practices, and review mechanisms. This approach balances technological advancement and ethical considerations within AI-driven HR processes. The significance of this chapter is to bring together academic sources and experts from the industry to provide a complete guide of integrating global best practices for implementing ethical AI. The proposed framework serves as a valuable tool for HR AI practitioners and researchers offering a structured approach to the ethical AI deployment while remaining adaptable to emerging challenges and opportunities in this rapidly growing area. \u00a9 2026 by A.R.

    "abstract": "The emerging technologies comprising of robotics, machine learning, artificial intelligence (AI), etc., provided a bouquet of the opportunities which can transform the business. In the recent years, AI also finds its important application in the human resource management (HRM). The aim of the study is to determine the variables affecting the ethical use of AI in HRM. The variables influencing the ethical use of AI in HRM are identified and analysed using interpretative structural modelling (ISM). A hierarchical diagraph model was created for these variables, illustrating their relationships and influence. Additionally, MICMAC (Matrice d'ImpactsCrois\u00e9s Multiplication Appliqu\u00e9e \u00e0 un Classement) analysis was used to categorise the variables. The variables influencing the ethical use of AI in HRM are identified and analysed through the use of ISM. A hierarchical digraph model was created for these variables, illustrating their relationships and influence. Additionally, MICMAC analysis was used to categorise the variables. The study identified key ethical variables affecting AI integration in HRM, such as ethical AI deployment (EAD), data privacy and security (DPS), regulatory compliance (RC) and so on. MICMAC analysis discovered that EAD and AI literacy (AIL) are the independent factors, management commitment (MC) and impact on employment (IE), RC and DPS are mediating and performance management (PM) and AI transparency (AIT) are dependent variables. The findings of this study provide organisations with guidance on developing ethical AI strategies in HRM. \u00a9 2026 by Sushma Sharma, Monika Agarwal and Anju Rohilla. All rights reserved.",

This study examines the potential benefits of algorithmic control, particularly through monitoring work activities and assessing performance, in enhancing employees' workplace well-being within conventional employment settings. Grounded in labour process theory, our analysis of a multi-wave data set reveals that both algorithmic monitoring and performance management can foster employees' perceptions of organizational fairness, which subsequently supports workplace well-being. Additionally, the study finds that algorithmic transparency further strengthens these positive effects, emphasizing the value of clear and accessible communication around algorithmic processes. These insights offer a practical framework for leveraging algorithmic tools to harness the power of precision, enhancing perceptions of fairness and promoting employee well-being. \u00a9 2024 Brian Towers (BRITOW) and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",

    "abstract": "Today, organizations are increasingly relying on automated hiring. The mechanization of the hiring process is assumed to render it more neutral, but a growing literature shows algorithmic decisions are as likely to be biased (Dickson, 2018). In this study, we test two types of biases: (1) gender bias; and (2) parenting bias, (i.e., whether mothers and fathers with an extended gap to care for children are penalized vis-\u00e0-vis those with uninterrupted employment net of equivalent high-impact qualifications). We apply a classic counterfactual study sending gender and parenthood manipulated CVs to 211 job advertisements across three occupations (men-dominated, women-dominated, and gender-balanced, to mitigate confounding variables associated with gender composition) in the United States and measure penalty-premium bias in response rates. Our results identify semi-automated hiring bias against parents who took leave to care for children relative to those with uninterrupted employment. Importantly, we find fathers who have an extended parental leave were the most severely penalized, followed by mothers with an extended parental leave and women and men without parental leave respectively. Ultimately, we identify gender and parenting bias in algorithmic and human hiring decisions. \u00a9 2024 Brian Towers (BRITOW) and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",

    "abstract": "Employees increasingly co-produce services with artificial intelligence (AI). Focusing on system design, this research uncovers (1) which system features qualify an AI system as a so-called collaborative intelligence (CI) system, (2) to what extent CI systems influence work-related employee outcomes, and (3) which CI features relate to which outcomes. Based on an extensive literature review and a qualitative study, we demarcate CI from related concepts\u2014such as hybrid intelligence, collective intelligence, and human-AI teaming\u2014and identify five relevant CI system features: engagement, transparency, process control, outcome control, and reciprocal strength enhancement. Employing two scenario-based experiments with financial services employees (N = 309) and HR professionals (N = 345), we demonstrate that strong CI systems (i.e., characterized by the aforementioned five features) significantly relate to perceived service improvement, perceived outcome responsibility, (threat to) meaning of work, and adherence to the system. Particularly, transparency, process control, and outcome control are important design features, while, surprisingly, engagement seems less relevant. We also identify previous AI experience of employees as an important contingency factor: effects are much stronger for AI novices. Our research contributes to service literature by defining CI systems, while practitioners may benefit from our blueprint for CI system design. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2024.

The models were provided two prompts per domain, and outputs were evaluated by academics across five criteria: accuracy, clarity, conciseness, systematic reasoning, and indicators of potential bias. The inter-rater reliability was reported using Cohen\u2019s Kappa. From the findings, both models display differences in performance. ChatGPT-5 outperformed DeepSeek in accounting and human resources, while DeepSeek outperformed ChatGPT-5 on epistemic economics tasks. Since results have shown that ChatGPT-5 outperformed DeepSeek in two out of three domains, the research recommends a reliability-based framework to compare generative AI outputs within business disciplines and offers practical suggestions on when and how to use the models within academic and professional contexts. \u00a9 2025 by the authors.",

However, a comprehensive synthesis of the intersection between AI and GHRM is notably absent, prompting this review to systematically map the existing knowledge base and identify key trends. To bride this research gap, a systematic literature review was undertaken following the PRISMA framework, employing content and bibliometric analysis on 53 relevant articles published between 2018 and 2025. The analysis revealed five primary research themes, highlighting AI\u2019s significant role in enhancing green recruitment, training, and performance management, while also underscoring critical challenges related to ethical considerations and organizational readiness. This review offers a structured synthesis of the AI-GHRM landscape, concluding with key interpretations that guide future research toward areas including adaptive systems, big data analytics, and the development of robust ethical frameworks, thereby serving as a valuable resource for advancing sustainable HRM practices.

    "abstract": "As the performance of artificial intelligence (AI) enabled algorithms to improve, so too increases the potential for them to be used to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of human resource management (HRM) decisions. Yet, public distrust in AI algorithms could keep organizations from using this technology to improve HRM decision-making. Here, we examine one factor that may influence the perceived trustworthiness of AI algorithms used in HRM, specifically those used in personnel selection decisions. Drawing from organizational justice and trust theories, we posit that knowledge of how the algorithm compares with human recruiters in terms of hiring members of traditionally discriminated demographic groups serves as a fairness heuristic that affects the algorithm's perceived trustworthiness by increasing its perceived ability, benevolence, and integrity. In three experimental studies (N = 1382), we show that when people are informed that an algorithm used in personnel selection results in more women or racial minorities being hired, as compared to selection decisions made by human recruiters, they perceive it as having higher ability, benevolence and integrity, and are more willing to adopt it and to follow its recommendations. The opposite is true when the algorithm is said to decrease the number of women and racial minorities being hired. Our research suggests that auditing personnel selection decisions made using AI algorithms and communicating how they compare with human recruiters in terms of their diversity, equity, and inclusion outcomes is important for the perceived trustworthiness and public acceptance of this technology. \u00a9 2025 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",

AM leverages machine-learning algorithms to help automate managerial functions. This raises key questions about its impact on work, organisations, and the broader society. This paper synthesises existing research on AM and categorizes scholarly insights into five theoretical perspectives: AM as a surveillance and control system, as a neutral tool, as an agentic boss, as a socio-technical process, and AM as a contradictory unity. While AM enhances coordination and efficiency, it also raises concerns such as pervasive surveillance, bias, dehumanization and worker alienation. We highlight the tensions between control and autonomy, transparency and opacity, and efficiency and fairness, illustrating the paradoxical nature of AM. This paper proposes a future research agenda, calling for ethical governance and responsible design of algorithmic systems to reap the benefits of AM while managing potential risks and mitigating harms. \u00a9 2025 The Author(s).

    "abstract": "AI and machine learning algorithms are revolutionising the modern workplace by transforming HR functions to deliver superior outcomes for both employees and organisations. However, research shows that these algorithms often fail to deliver optimal HR solutions, primarily due to inherent biases. Developing capabilities to overcome algorithmic biases is critical for firms, as these biases present significant challenges to fairness and inclusivity in HR decision-making, ultimately impacting the effectiveness of HR practices. To address this challenge, our study, grounded in the dynamic capability perspective, presents a model to address algorithmic biases in people management and achieve superior strategic HR outcomes. To test our theoretical model, we collected survey data using a two-wave, time-lagged approach from HR professionals and employees working in firms within the Australian financial and insurance industries. The key findings reveal three critical dimensions of HR algorithmic bias management capability: data bias, model bias, and deployment bias management capabilities, which significantly influence AI-enabled high-performance HR practices and, in turn, positively impact strategic HRM effectiveness. Our novel findings on the dimensions of HR bias management capability contribute to advancing the dynamic capability view in HRM research. They also offer a comprehensive bias management framework that allows HR professionals to address the strategic, ethical, and operational challenges emerging from the use of AI-augmented HR practices in the dynamic workplace, helping sustain a competitive advantage. \u00a9 2025 The Author(s).

This study aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how these technologies transform HR processes while addressing ethical concerns and implications for employee well-being and engagement. Design/methodology/approach \u2013 This study uses a systematic literature review methodology, analysing peer-reviewed academic journals, industry reports and relevant books published between 2000 and 2023. The research uses a tripartite framework to explore the positive aspects (\u201cThe Good\u201d), challenges and limitations (\u201cThe Bad\u201d) and ethical considerations (\u201cThe Ugly\u201d) of Web-based HRM systems, with particular attention to employee engagement and organizational effectiveness. Findings \u2013 This study reveals that Web-based HR systems significantly enhance efficiency in recruitment, compensation and payroll management. However, they also present substantial challenges related to data security, user competence and system integration. Ethical concerns emerge regarding privacy, potential biases in artificial intelligence-driven decision-making and the risk of over-dependency on technology. The research underscores the need for a balanced approach in implementing these systems, considering both their transformative potential and impact on employee well-being. Originality/value \u2013 This study contributes to the existing literature by providing a nuanced, holistic examination of Web-based HRM systems. It extends the theoretical landscape by addressing the darker sides of HR technology adoption, including ethical dilemmas and potential negative impacts on employee engagement.

    "abstract": "Purpose \u2013 This study focuses on enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of employee performance prediction to enhance decision making and improve organisational productivity. By introducing advance machine learning (ML) techniques, this study aims to create a more reliable and data-driven approach to evaluate employee performance. Design/methodology/approach \u2013 In this study, nine machine learning (ML) models were used for forecasting employee performance: Random Forest, AdaBoost, CatBoost, LGB Classifier, SVM, KNN, XGBoost, Decision Tree and one Hybrid model (SVM + XGBoost). Each ML model is trained on an HR data set covering various features such as employee demographics, job-related factors and past performance records, ensuring reliable performance predictions. Feature scaling techniques, namely, min-max scaling, Standard Scaler and PCA, have been used to enhance the effectiveness of employee performance prediction. The models are trained to classify data, predicting whether an employee\u2019s performance meets expectations or needs improvement. Findings \u2013 All proposed models used in the study can correctly categorize data with an average accuracy of 94%. Notably, the Random Forest model demonstrates the highest accuracy across all three scaling techniques, achieving optimise accuracy, respectively. The results presented have significant implications for HR procedures, providing businesses with the opportunity to make data-driven decisions, improve personnel management and foster a more effective and productive workforce. Research limitations/implications \u2013 The scope of the used data set limits the study, despite our models delivering high accuracy. Further research could extend to different data sets or more diverse organisational settings to validate the model\u2019s effectiveness across various contexts. Practical implications \u2013 The proposed ML models in the study provide essential tools for HR departments, enabling them to make more informed data driven decisions with regard to employee performance. This approach can enhance personnel management, improve workforce productivity and fostering a more effective organisational environment. Social implications \u2013 Although AI models have shown promising outcomes, it is crucial to recognise the constraints and difficulties involved in their use. To ensure the fair and responsible use of AI in employee performance prediction, ethical considerations, privacy problems and any biases in the data should be properly addressed. Future work will be required to improve and broaden the capabilities of AI models in predicting employee performance. Originality/value \u2013 This study introduces an exclusive combination of ML models for accurately predicting employee performance. By employing these advanced techniques, the study offers novel insight into how organisations might transition from a conventional evaluation method to a more advanced and objective, data-backed approach. \u00a9 2024 Emerald Publishing Limited",

Digitalization significantly transforms business life by accelerating work and facilitating data collection and management processes. Human resources (HR) management is also affected by this transformation as the world changes rapidly. While institutions compete to recruit the most qualified and high-potential employees, HR departments try to stand out in this race by hiring talent with their digital and innovative applications. In the digital age, using artificial intelligence (AI) in talent acquisition eliminates human-related errors such as bias, subjectivity, and similarity effects in recruitment processes, speeds up time-consuming processes such as resume screening, candidate pool evaluation, and interviews with AI-supported predictive analyses, and suggestion systems, and provides cost advantage. However, although AI accelerates recruitment processes and reduces costs, human intuition and evaluations are essential in critical stages such as personality and competency analyses and job, person, and organizational culture compatibility. In order to optimize talent acquisition in the age of AI, it would be helpful to examine the literature and application examples on which stages of the recruitment process and to what extent AI will be used. This study aims to explain the digital world's and AI's effects on talent acquisition and evaluate them with application examples. \u00a9 2025 Alessandra Lazazzara and V. Lale T\u00fcz\u00fcner.",

Design-methodology-approach: The investigation adopted a two-phase research strategy. First, bibliometric analysis of AI-HRM evidence received attention from most scholars indicating major topics of concern within the AI and HRM corpus. Second, a systematic literature review (SLR) based on these themes and applied focus key strings and PRISMA protocols to ensure satisfactory efforts in locating and discussing the relevant literature. Findings: The bibliometric analysis suggested three points of interest that are popular in the literature: AI in recruitment and diversity, employee development, and bias reduction. These programs can be used from mere training employees to including operational supervision and engagement. The case studies featured some well-known brands such as Unilever, Accenture, and IBM. The results indicate a possibility that AI will assist in the advancement of HRM processes, foster diversity, and inclusiveness and even bias-free recruitment and development of employees. Practical implications: The chapter proposes guidelines for the ethical application of AI in HR, including meticulous data collection, algorithmic design, and routine supervision. It emphasizes that AI possesses transformative potential for achieving diversity and inclusion in workplaces. Originality: This chapter expands on the ongoing discussion of AI in HRM by providing a bibliometric approach and SLR, making a new and substantiated claim on Al's role in promoting diversity and reducing biases. \u00a9 2025 by Arun Kumar P, Rekha Aranha and Delma Thaliyan.

    "abstract": "Purpose: This chapter examines the link between AI adoption in HR and misinformation, discussing its impacts on organizational growth and recommending mitigating strategies. It aims to advance both theoretical understanding and practical guidance for organizations navigating these challenges. Need for the study: AI plays a critical role in promoting organizational growth via data-driven decision-making. However, AI-related misinformation poses significant challenges, such as resource misallocation and erosion of employee trust, which need to be addressed to fully harness AI's potential in HR. Methodology: A systematic analysis of academic literature, industry practices, and real-world cases. It integrates theoretical perspectives such as socio-technical systems theory and risk management to develop a novel 2 \u00d7 2 framework categorizing AI-related misinformation by potential harm and prevalence. Findings: The 2 \u00d7 2 framework identifies four categories of AI-related misinformation challenges: (1) Critical risks: High harm, high prevalence, (2) Widespread challenges: Low harm, high prevalence, (3) Emerging threats: High harm, low prevalence, and (4) Minor concerns: Low harm, low prevalence. The analysis highlights how misinformation can lead to resource misallocation and undermine employee trust. It underscores the importance of AI literacy programs and transparent AI policies in combating these challenges. Practical implications: Organizations that proactively address AI-related misinformation through systematic assessment and management will achieve long-term growth and competitive advantage. The chapter provides real-world examples and emphasizes the implementation of AI literacy initiatives and transparent policies to mitigate risks effectively. \u00a9 2025 by Lillian Stewart, Yuanyuan (Gina) Cui and Patrick van Esch.

    "abstract": "Purpose: While ushering in the digital in human resource management (HRM), much of practitioners' conversation happens about the ethics of AI and, more particularly, how it contrasts with AI biases. In this study, we intend to offer nuanced understanding for leveraging AI potentialities while upholding ethical standards and precluding unintended biases. Need for the study: For HR functionaries, addressing both biases and ethics stands as a strategic imperative. This study presents an overview of the biases that can be manifested in AI-driven HR functions and approaches to counter them. Additionally, we discuss the issues that need to be viewed from ethical perspectives by HR professionals. Methodology: This review paper examines the extant literature to offer a comprehensive insight of the existing research paradigm. In line with the research questions (RQs), the scientific field is examined to provide in depth understanding of ethical concerns and biases in the AI-augmented HR processes. Findings: The present study discerns the major sources of AI biases and ethical considerations in automated HR processes. The actionable strategies underlying ethical principles and theoretical frameworks for integration in HRM practices to enable mitigation of AI biases have been discussed. Finally, the future directions in light of these developments have been put forth. Practical implications: AI biases and associated ethical implications are potential threats for AI implementation. Significant changes in the existing AI frameworks will facilitate achieving favourable outcomes, raising trust and creating an equitable workplace. \u00a9 2025 by Stuti Jalan and Lalatendu Kesari Jena.

    "abstract": "The widespread integration of data-driven technologies in hiring highlights the need for appropriate fairness assessment methodologies. With AI applications in hiring classified as high-risk systems in the European Union, vendors are compelled to manage discrimination risks carefully throughout development and integration in personnel selection. This necessitates a critical examination of how fairness is conceptualized and operationalized in hiring practice. By conducting group and individual interviews with diverse stakeholders in the German-speaking market, our research evaluates the alignment between technical research findings and industry expectations and practices, as well as the congruence of stakeholder perspectives, especially HR practitioners and technology developers. Our findings underscore the influence of organizational norms and diversity goals on practitioners' fairness conceptions, adding complexity to the already fragmented landscape. While all participants endorsed normative principles such as transparency and standardization, many lacked awareness of the limitations and challenges of implementing them in practice. Concrete operationalization of fairness emerged as a challenge for almost all participants, particularly HR practitioners, who showed limited familiarity with fairness metrics and often expressed skepticism toward both group-level and individual-level measures. This study highlights the necessity for stronger engagement with HR departments in fairness and technology research. We argue that ensuring fairness in AI-assisted hiring requires shared vocabularies, configurable fairness evaluations, targeted training, and collaborative infrastructures to enable robust and effective oversight of the development and usage of these technologies. \u00a9 2025 Association for Computing Machinery.

    "abstract": "The rapid digital transformation reshaping business landscapes has significantly impacted Human Resource Management (HRM), with AI and data analytics playing a pivotal role in recruitment processes. Digital Recruiting 3.0, characterized by AI-driven hiring tools like job description generators, targeted ads, and chatbots, not only offers improved efficiency and candidate experiences but also introduces challenges, including ethical concerns, candidate quality, and the loss of personal touch. A study investigating AI adoption in recruitment identified four key themes: job description creation, targeted advertising, candidate engagement, and automated scheduling. While AI adoption boosts efficiency and reduces bias in some industries, others face barriers related to ethics, costs, and employee adaptation. The research highlights the strategic importance of HR digital transformation, emphasizing the need for a balanced approach between automation and human interaction, along with addressing training and cost concerns to foster organizational competitiveness. \u00a9 2025 by Bhavya Kalra and Dr Shuchi Dikshit.

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has significantly influenced human resource management (HRM), presenting both opportunities and challenges for individuals and organizations. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the integration of AI in HRM, exploring its multifaceted implications on employee perceptions, engagement, and organizational practices. A systematic literature review was conducted, focusing on journal articles published between 2018 and 2024. The review includes studies examining AI's role in enhancing HR processes, such as recruitment, employee monitoring, performance evaluation, and training, while emphasizing its ethical and legal considerations. Findings reveal that while AI has the potential to revolutionize HRM by streamlining processes and improving decision-making, its application raises concerns regarding employee trust, data privacy, and bias in algorithms. The study highlights diverse perspectives on the relationship between AI and HR, showcasing the dual role of AI as a tool for efficiency and a challenge to human-centric management approaches. A novel contribution of this paper is the development of an AI + HR model framework, specifically designed to assist HR managers in navigating the complexities of AI-driven systems. This framework provides practical insights for leveraging AI in HRM to enhance employee engagement and organizational outcomes. Despite its contributions, the study is limited to a specific timeframe and excludes certain types of literature, such as non-English articles and conference papers. Nevertheless, it offers valuable implications for HR practitioners and researchers by advancing the understanding of AI's transformative role in HRM. \u00a9 2025 by @@. All rights reserved.",

    "abstract": "The importance of employee well-being in fostering innovation, customer satisfaction, and profitability is becoming more widely acknowledged. This review article emphasizes how sentiment analysis, which was once primarily used for consumer insights, is now being used to track employees' emotional well-being and enable early intervention against burnout, stress, and disengagement. Sentiment analysis has been used by numerous businesses to improve retention and workplace policies. However, there are many obstacles because of ethical worries about algorithmic bias, privacy, and trust. Informed consent, data anonymization, staff involvement, and human oversight are necessary for successful implementation. To evaluate its long-term effects on workplace culture, longitudinal research is required. It can be concluded that while sentiment analysis presents a transformative opportunity for data-driven HR management, its success hinges on ethical stewardship, fostering a workplace where employees feel heard, respected, and supported. \u00a9 2026, IGI Global Scientific Publishing.

We conducted an experiment to better understand when and how ethical concerns could arise. In total, 379 managers made either one or multiple organizational decisions with input from a human or AI source. We found that, when making multiple, simultaneous decisions, managers who received AI recommendations were more likely to exhibit lowered moral awareness, meaning reduced recognition of a situation\u2019s moral or ethical implications, compared with those receiving human guidance. This tendency did not occur when making a single decision. In supplemental experiments, we found that receiving AI recommendations on multiple decisions increased the likelihood of making a less ethical choice. These findings highlight the importance of developing organizational policies that mitigate ethical risks posed by using AI in decision-making. Such policies could, for example, nudge employees toward recalling ethical guidelines or reduce the volume of decisions that are made simultaneously. \u00a9 Behavioral Science & Policy Association 2025.

    "abstract": "Sustainable innovation represents both a strategic priority and survival imperative for small- and medium-sized enterprises in resource-constrained economies. While digital transformation offers potential solutions, the synergistic effects of digital leadership, employee behaviors, and emerging technologies remain poorly understood. This study bridges this gap by developing and testing a behavioral-tech leadership framework grounded in the Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) model and Technology Acceptance Model. Analyzing survey data from 400 Iraqi SME employees using partial least squares structural equation modeling, we demonstrate that digital leadership directly enhances sustainable innovation while reducing counterproductive cyberloafing. Crucially, social cyberloafing, when properly managed, emerges as a positive mediator, improving employee well-being and creativity, particularly among mid-career and educated workers. Artificial Intelligence\u2019s integration further amplifies these effects by optimizing operational efficiency and reducing human-resource strain. These findings challenge conventional perspectives by repositioning cyberloafing as a conditional resource within the JD-R framework and provide actionable insights for achieving sustainable innovation even in challenging environments. Practical implications include gender-inclusive digital leadership programs, ethical AI implementation guidelines and restorative cyberloafing policies. The study contributes to United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 8 (decent work), 9 (industry innovation) and 12 (responsible consumption) while highlighting the transformative potential of human-centric digital strategies in resource-constrained contexts. \u00a9 2025 by the authors.",

    "abstract": "The integration of artificial intelligence plays a critical role in human resource management in local governments by ensuring smooth, essential HR operations, including recruitment, performance management, and workforce planning. The current study is a systematic review focused on determining the performance management factors that should be considered when using artificial intelligence in the local government sector. Although artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming increasingly integrated into the governance and administrative systems of local governments around the world, this study raises critical questions about how performance should be managed, measured, and improved. Articles were screened based on their title, abstract, and keywords, following which the inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied. A comprehensive search was conducted in the EBSCOhost, Emerald Insight, Taylor & Francis, Scopus, and SpringerLink databases. These databases were chosen because they are prominent sources that publish various materials related to the social sciences. This scoping review followed the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines and included 22 peer-reviewed empirical studies published between 2015 and 2025. Analysis of the identified 22 peer-reviewed articles revealed that the successful application of AI in local government performance management depends on six critical performance management factors: data quality and accessibility; strategic alignment with performance goals; evaluation criteria and metrics; ethical and legal oversight; institutional capacity and leadership; and change management and stakeholder engagement. These factors are interdependent and represent both technical and organisational dimensions of public administration. This study highlights that AI entails more than innovation; it reshapes the foundations of performance governance, requiring new capabilities, values, and institutional practices. \u00a9 2025 by the authors.",

These diverse urban contexts, spanning a broad portfolio of hotel brands from luxury to economy, provide a rich setting for exploring how AI integration affects employee attitudes and work\u2013life balance. A total of 437 employees participated in the survey, offering a robust dataset for structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis. Exploratory factor analysis identified two primary factors shaping perceptions: AI Perceptions, which encompasses employee views on AI\u2019s impact on job performance, communication, recognition, and retention, and balanced management, reflecting attitudes toward fairness, personal consideration, productivity, and skill development in AI-managed environments. The results reveal a complex but optimistic view, where employees acknowledge AI\u2019s potential to enhance operational efficiency and career optimism but also express concerns about flexibility loss and the need for human oversight. The findings underscore the importance of transparent communication, contextual sensitivity, and continuous training in implementing AI systems that support both organizational goals and employee well-being. This study contributes valuable insights to hospitality management by highlighting the relational and ethical dimensions of algorithmic HR systems across varied organizational and cultural settings. \u00a9 2025 by the authors.",

Previous studies have primarily focused on the benefits that AI brings to the HRM process. Despite increasing attention to the applicant\u2019s perspective, conflicting findings persist regarding how applicants respond to AI-driven decision-making processes. Drawing upon prospect theory, we conducted a survey in campus recruitment and four online experiments about HRM decisions to determine if applicants hold a lay belief that an AI agent is more consistent than a human in making decisions, and furthermore, if applicants\u2019 relative advantage strongly affects their preference for AI decision-making. Specifically, we found that applicants who are at an advantage prefer AI decision-making more than those at a disadvantage because they desire a highly consistent agent to maintain their existing advantages. However, their preference for AI decreases when decision-making is not transparent. Our findings not only help to clarify when and why applicants like or dislike AI decision makers but also provide advice for HRM departments to better employ AI decision-making systems. \u00a9 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025.",

    "abstract": "Human advisors typically explain their reasoning, which is absent when advice is given by an algorithm in the form of a mere number. We hypothesized that decision maker perceptions (e.g., trust), use of algorithmic advice, and hence judgment consistency and accuracy would improve if an algorithm \u2018explains itself\u2019. We recruited 1,202 English-speaking adults via Prolific who predicted the performance of a draw of 40 job candidates based on their assessment information and algorithmic advice. We used a 2 (narrative advice: yes/no) \u00d7 2 (narrative algorithm information: yes/no) \u00d7 2 (algorithmic advice as default: yes/no) between-subjects design. The first factor varied whether participants received mere numeric algorithmic advice or numeric advice plus a short case-by-case narrative explanation based on the specific candidate information. The second factor varied whether, before the task, the algorithm\u2019s design and predictor weight choice were introduced in a narrative manner by a human character, using first-person language or in a descriptive manner. The third factor varied whether participants\u2019 predictions defaulted to the algorithmic advice or an irrelevant value. Most effects were detectable but small in magnitude. The results showed that participants used narrative advice somewhat more than mere numeric advice, but only when their prediction did not default to the advice. Furthermore, participants had more trust, stronger feelings of human interaction, higher judgment consistency, and higher intentions to use the algorithm for future decisions when they received case-by-case narrative advice. People seem to feel more comfortable with algorithmic advice when receiving an explanation for each decision. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2025.",

It examines the potential of AI to optimise HR processes while ensuring ethical considerations and social responsibility are integrated into corporate strategies. Purpose of the article: The aim of the article is to identify and quantify the causal relationships between human resource management, corporate social responsibility, and the perception of artificial intelligence within the company as key aspects of sustainable business development. Methods: Research was conducted in the Czech business environment based on 451 responses from HR managers in medium-to large-sized companies. A uniquely designed questionnaire was created to capture the respondents' subjective attitudes in September 2024. The hypotheses were evaluated using the application of structural equation modelling (SEM). Findings & value added: The findings confirm that CSR activities exert a clear and positive impact on HRM, whereas AI, despite its significant potential to enhance HR processes, is not yet fully implemented or utilised at an optimal level. In addition, we have also analysed the relationship between AI and CSR, and empirical findings indicate that AI can significantly support CSR activities as these two domains had the potential to enhance the competitiveness of the organisation. Our results emphasise the necessity for policy makers and managers to enhance CSR focused HRM practices and to support guidelines to ensure the ethical deployment of AI as the ethical and social implications of implementing AI in HR and CSR present another key challenge, including data bias and privacy concerns. \u00a9 Instytut Bada\u0144 Gospodarczych / Institute of Economic Research (Poland).",

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly reshaping recruitment processes by automating candidate screening, interviews, and hiring decisions. Despite its growing adoption, AI-enabled recruitment tools raise significant ethical and psychological concerns among job candidates, particularly regarding fairness, transparency, risk, and trust. Addressing a notable research gap concerning candidate perspectives, this study aims to investigate job candidates\u2019 acceptance of AI-enabled recruitment tools, examining how perceived usefulness, ease of use, fairness, transparency, and risk influence their attitudes, mediated by trust and moderated by AI experience. Drawing on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), and the Fairness, Accountability, Transparency, and Explainability (FATE) framework, the study introduces a socio-technical conceptual model to address the identified research gap. A quantitative survey was conducted with 143 job applicants in Jordan\u2019s pharmaceutical sector. The data were analysed using SPSS multiple regression analysis to assess the relationships among the variables. The findings show that perceived fairness, transparency, usefulness, and trust significantly shape positive attitudes toward AI-enabled hiring. Whereas ease of use and risk perceptions are less influential, trust proved to be a vital mediator, particularly between job applicants' perceptions of fairness and transparency and their attitudes toward AI-enabled recruitment tools, while prior AI experience moderates the influence of transparency and risk perceptions. The study concludes that respondents placed greater importance on AI's ethical and relational characteristics than technical functionality, highlighting the importance of designing functionally efficient, but also ethically responsible, fair, trustworthy, and transparent AI-enabled recruitment tools to promote candidates\u2019 acceptance and enhance responsible AI adoption in emerging labour markets. \u00a9 2025 by the authors.",

Leveraging institutional data on faculty demographics, educational backgrounds, and career histories, we preprocess unstructured data via rigorous techniques such as one-hot encoding, and temporal feature engineering. The RF model, optimized with balanced class weights and bootstrap aggregation, demonstrates robust predictive performance. Permutation importance analysis identifies highest education (importance score: 0.2105) as the dominant predictor, underscoring the institutional prioritization of advanced degrees in promotion systems. While age (0.1210) and gender (0.0974) exhibit significant influence, the minimal impact of work experience (0.0684) suggests latent biases favoring chronological age over explicit tenure. Notably, ethnicity shows negligible relevance (0.0026), aligning with equity policies. Methodologically, this work validates permutation importance as a model-agnostic tool for auditing fairness in educational HR systems. The findings urge universities to re-examine promotion criteria by integrating competency-based metrics and addressing implicit age-gender disparities. This study contributes to educational technology by bridging predictive analytics with policy design for equitable academic career development. \u00a9 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)",

However, it is largely unclear how applicants would react to the use of AI technology in such a context marked by high stakes and (at least partly) conflicting interests, which need to be resolved to terminate the recruitment process successfully. Therefore, we examined how AI negotiation agents influence negotiators' trust in and expectations about an upcoming employment negotiation. In a preregistered experimental vignette study, participants (n = 291) imagined to prepare for an employment negotiation. Varying the type of negotiation counterpart (human\u2014AI with avatar\u2014AI without avatar), we assessed participants' trust intentions and subjective value expectations regarding the anticipated negotiation. We found higher trust and more positive expectations for human counterparts as compared to AI counterparts, regardless of whether the AI was presented with or without an avatar. However, participants' technology-related attitudes and skills attenuated this effect, leading to less negative effects for AI as a negotiation counterpart when participants possessed high skills and positive attitudes regarding digital technologies. Overall, this study provides initial evidence of how people would react to AI agents in mixed-motive and conflict resolution settings and may serve as a starting point for developing evidence-based guidelines for designing AI agents for HR and conflict resolution settings. \u00a9 2025 The Author(s).

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping industries and workforce demands globally. To ensure that individuals are prepared for an increasingly AI-driven world, it is crucial to develop robust AI literacy and address persistent gender biases in STEM fields. This paper presents a comparative study of AI literacy and gender bias among 192 participants from the United Kingdom and Indonesia. Using a survey-based approach, the study examines participants\u2019 familiarity with AI concepts, confidence in utilizing AI tools, and engagement in ethical discussions related to AI. The findings reveal that while overall AI literacy levels are similar across both countries, UK respondents demonstrate significantly higher familiarity with programming and AI technologies, likely reflecting differences in educational frameworks and digital infrastructure. Moreover, despite widespread use of AI, discussions on its ethical implications remain limited in both countries. The study also highlights persistent gender biases that affect women\u2019s participation and progression in AI and STEM fields; differences in perceptions of gender bias in recruitment, leadership promotion, and support for women suggest that, although progress is being made, significant barriers still exist. The study uncovers nuanced cultural variations in the perception of gender bias: UK participants exhibit greater confidence in gender inclusivity within recruitment and leadership roles, whereas Indonesian respondents report a higher prevalence of targeted initiatives to support women in technology. Overall, this research deepens our understanding of how AI literacy varies across diverse cultural and technological landscapes and offers valuable strategic guidance for tailoring interventions to overcome specific barriers, ultimately supporting innovative developments for women in STEM and women in AI in particular. \u00a9 2025 by the authors.",

This study examines the relationship between AI service quality and job satisfaction, considering the mediating effect of perceived organizational justice and the moderating influence of supervisor support. Drawing on the ISS model, equity, organizational justice, and Leader\u2013Member Exchange (LMX) theory, data were collected from a diverse sample of service sector employees through a cross-sectional design. The findings indicate that higher AI service quality significantly enhances job satisfaction, particularly in environments with strong supervisor support. Contrary to expectations, perceived organizational justice did not mediate the AI-satisfaction link, suggesting that perceived organizational justice constructs may be less influential in AI-mediated contexts. Instead, supervisor support emerged as a key contextual enabler, strengthening employees\u2019 positive perceptions and emotional responses to AI systems. These results emphasize that technological optimization alone is insufficient for building sustainable service workplaces. Effective leadership and human-centered practices remain essential to fostering trust, satisfaction, and long-term engagement in digitally transforming organizations. This study offers practical and theoretical insights into integrating AI and human resource strategies in support of socially sustainable service systems. \u00a9 2025 by the authors.",

    "abstract": "This study explores the relationship between artificial intelligence (AI) and career plateaus among women working in corporate finance roles in Istanbul. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with seven professionals occupying junior, mid-level, and managerial positions. The interviews focused on everyday applications of AI, including performance dashboards, promotion lists, learning recommendations, and financial forecasting and reporting. Perceptions of both opportunities and challenges were examined, together with their influence on feelings of career stagnation or progress. A reflexive thematic analysis was applied. The findings suggest that AI helps make employee contributions more visible and supports performance discussions with shared evidence. Personalized learning recommendations were described as valuable, particularly for early-career employees seeking direction. However, several difficulties emerged. Some aspects of work, such as coordination, mentoring, and handling crises, were often overlooked by AI metrics. The constant presence of scoring mechanisms was reported to create pressure and anxiety. In addition, decision-making processes sometimes slowed down when AI outputs were mediated by unclear committee structures. More positive results were observed when AI was used in an advisory role, supported by transparent human review and regular bias checks. Career planning was more effective when personal circumstances such as mobility, language, and caregiving responsibilities were recognized. Although based on a small and non-random sample, the study offers evidence from Istanbul and highlights pathways for broader future research. \u00a9 Metin Karademir.",

Design/Methodology: Mixed method of research is used which consists of exploratory and analytical research. A structured questionnaire was used for data collection, and statistical tests were used for data analysis. Findings: Key results include that males are more technologically literate than females, and no statistical differences were observed in the levels of trust in AI or the ease of navigation. Research Limitations/Implications: The study is limited to the AI-powered Employee Chatbot. The findings indicate that the AI-powered system is effective in capturing feedback. Thus, the results contain recommendations for improving the effectiveness of the system. Practical Implications: This study offers several suggestions which may help managers enhance the management of AI Systems in the organisations. According to Krejcie and Morgan's, when the employees are trained on how to interact with the AI systems the user acceptance is enhancing the performance of the systems.

Purpose: The research aims to understand how AI influences decision-making and the critical skills managers and Human Resources (HR) professionals need in this evolving landscape. Design/Methodology/Approach: A desk research methodology was employed, synthesising findings from sources like Elsevier, Wiley and Emerald. Keywords such as AI, decision-making, HR soft skills and critical thinking guided the search to create a cohesive conceptual framework by integrating key studies. Findings: AI can accelerate decision-making through real-time forecasts but may lead to 'deskilling' or a decline in human expertise. Critical thinking and soft skills are essential to bridge gaps requiring human judgement and insight. Research Limitations: Africa's cultural, political and economic diversity may limit the applicability of the proposed frameworks across the continent. Practical Implications: The proposed model fosters critical thinking, enabling ethical and well-informed decision-making while reducing over-reliance on AI. It ensures culturally appropriate solutions, enhances adaptability and promotes regionally relevant problem-solving through AI literacy and continuous education. Social Implications: Promoting critical thinking in AI applications can preserve local knowledge, reduce inequality and ensure equitable distribution of AI benefits across African societies.

    "abstract": "The future of the 'human' in human resources (HR) is being shaped by several broad environmental factors, including technological changes, shifting demographics in terms of workers and leaders, and changing organizational forms. This paper reviews these trends to remind ourselves of the stakes involved and then focus on several specific trends relevant to technology, diversity, and work-life issues. Artificial intelligence (AI), social media-based networks, and other technological advances provide opportunities for enhancing HR functions but also involve risks related to privacy and accuracy that may limit their optimal use. It poses questions related to the role technology versus human plays in future HR systems, the ethical considerations surrounding AI, particularly within an HR context, and what skills should characterize successful HR practitioners of tomorrow. The study presents key insights pertaining to how a 'human' essence in HR can be preserved or even strengthened through creating new digital possibilities. This report investigates how human-centeredness in HR is responding to the rise of artificial intelligence, automation, and data analytics integration. We further discuss multiple drivers that emphasize the urgency for HR professionals to proactively adapt if they want to shape their function or field rather than having it shaped for them. \u00a9 2026 Pushan Kumar Dutta, Amarnath Padhi, Sulagna Das, Vinod Kr Sharma and Poshan Yu.

Hires are made quicker with AI tools, tailor-made plans for learning are generated and real-time data provides insight into which employees might leave and how best to allocate resources. Artificial intelligence (AI) also contributes in making workplaces more diverse by eliminating biased decisions while selecting people for jobs and promotions. By examining employee emotions and providing self-service HR systems, it enhances the psychological state of employees. But there are still kinks that need working out, such as AI biases, data privacy issues, and how well workers will be able to adjust. These problems must be addressed through ethical standards as well as transparency in AI systems if trust is to grow. This section outlines guidance for adopting AI as part of sustainable, people-centric HR practices. It emphasizes preparing workers for the future, making decisions people can understand and planning with data. And the blending of new technology with Human-First strategies is a mix of companies who are looking to be competitive for the longhaul must integrate today. By providing experts with actionable insights on how they can navigate digital transformation and retain the entire workforce without compromising equality, this study adds to discussions that were already taking place about AI in Human Resources. \u00a9 2026 Pushan Kumar Dutta, Amarnath Padhi, Sulagna Das, Vinod Kr Sharma and Poshan Yu.

In this chapter we examine the future role of humans in HRM with fast-growing automation and AI integration, therefore exploring how HRM is developing. At the same time, even though administrative tasks have been automated by AI and machine learning toward making data-driven decisions, human element has remained important in developing organizational culture, empathy, and ethical considerations. The current investigation weighs the technology against humanistic aspects of the HRM to show why emotional intelligence matters more than IT skills, creativity matters more than data analysis, and strategic thinking matters more than programming. When routine/mundane tasks are left to technology, HR professionals can engage in strategic responsibilities such as talent development, employee engagement, and change management among others. Based on these findings, it is important for HR practitioners to be continuously adaptable through upskilling so that they can navigate their roles within a digital workforce, with its continuously evolving nature.

The proposed 7-stage methodology leverages behavioral data from online learning platforms to assess candidate skills, motivation, and adaptability more objectively than traditional methods. Key components include automated candidate profiling, multi-source data integration, AI-powered interviews, and continuous improvement mechanisms. The approach addresses critical limitations of conventional recruitment, including human bias, inefficiency in evaluating soft skills, and information overload. While offering benefits such as improved candidate-job matching and reduced subjectivity, the chapter also examines implementation challenges, including the issue of algorithmic bias, data privacy concerns, and ethical considerations.

Existing research primarily focuses on AI\u2019s effects on organizational performance and job design, with limited exploration of its mechanisms influencing individual employees, particularly in the critical area of risk-taking behavior, which is essential to organizational innovation. This research develops a moderated mediation model grounded in social cognitive theory (SCT) to explore how AI usage affects the willingness to take risks. A three-wave longitudinal study collected and statistically analyzed data from 442 participants. The findings reveal that (1) AI usage significantly enhances employees\u2019 willingness to take risks; (2) self-efficacy serves as a partial mediator in the connection between AI usage and the willingness to take risks; and (3) learning goal orientation moderates both the relationship between AI usage and self-efficacy, as well as the mediating effect. This research enhances our understanding of AI\u2019s impact on organizational behavior and provides valuable insights for human resource management in the AI era. \u00a9 2025 by the authors.",

Despite its benefits for organizations, whether job applicants favor the adoption of AI-based interview remains unclear. In the present research, we draw on expectancy theory to propose a contingent model explaining when and why applicants are more willing to accept an AI-based interview (vs. human-based interview). We introduce relative competency strength to identify whether AI-based interviews fit their applicants' unique competency. Across three experimental studies (total N = 760), we found that AI-based interview (vs. human-based interview) induced both higher uniqueness neglect expectations and higher fairness expectations of applicants. Moreover, applicants' relative competency strength moderated the impacts on both expectations separately. Specifically, applicants with higher cognitive competency strength had stronger fairness expectations and applicants with higher non-cognitive competency strength had stronger uniqueness neglect expectations, which further differentiated their subsequent job seeking strategies. Overall, our research implies that job applicants' reactions toward AI-based interviews depend on their recognition of their relative competency strength, suggesting an adaptive approach to job applications. \u00a9 2025",

Concerns have arisen about the potential for personality assessment manipulation using LLMs, posing a risk to the validity of these tools. This threat is a reality: recent research suggests that many\u00a0candidates are using AI to complete pre-hire assessments. This study addresses this problem by examining whether ChatGPT can outperform humans in faking personality assessments while avoiding detection. To explore this, two experiments were conducted focusing on assessing job-relevant traits, with and without coaching, and with two methods of identifying faking, specifically using an impression management (IM) measure and an overclaiming questionnaire (OCQ). For each study, we used responses from 100 working adults recruited via the Prolific platform, which were compared to 100 replications from ChatGPT. The results revealed that while ChatGPT showed some ability to manipulate assessments, without coaching it did not consistently outperform humans. Coaching had a minimal impact on reducing IM scores for either humans or ChatGPT, but reduced OCQ bias scores for ChatGPT. These findings highlight the limitations of current faking detection measures and emphasize the need for further research to refine methods for ensuring the integrity of personality assessments in HR, particularly as artificial intelligence becomes more available to candidates. \u00a9 2025 The Author(s).

    "abstract": "Using Artificial Intelligence (AI) for hiring is becoming a common practice among the employers. However, there is a lack of empirical evidence in academia about how job applicants react to such utilization. In this empirical study, we tried to investigate the relationship between perceived (by job applicants) use of AI in the hiring process (PUAHP) and job applicants\u2019 perceived procedural justice (PPJ) using an extension of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) as mediators [perceived ease of use (PEU), perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived trust (PT)]. The study was conducted based on primary data collected from 418 job applicants in Bangladesh. We used SPSS 26 for descriptive statistics and partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) through SmartPLS 4.0. The study identified that, first of all, PUAHP has a significant positive relationship with the dependent variable, PPJ. Second, PUAHP was also found to be significantly correlated with all three mediators (PEU, PU and PT). Third, PEU, PU and PT were identified to have significant positive relationships with PPJ. Finally, regarding the mediating effects, we found that all three mediators partially mediated the relationship between PUAHP and PPJ. Although, there are sufficient empirical studies that have focused on the use of AI in the hiring process, comparatively less attention has been put so far particularly on job applicants' percpetions of such an use of AI in the hiring process. Therefore, this study can add value to the existing knowledge by reducing such lacking. Moreover, we used three components of the extended TAM as mediators which is an unique effort in academia. Furthermore, the study was conducted based on primary responses in an emerging economy which is also rare in academia. \u00a9 2025 The Authors",

    "abstract": "This research work studies how AI can improve human resource strategies to resolve current challenges and create a data-driven, personalized workspace. Issues regarding handling comprehensive databases, decision-making based on evidence, selection, and retention of the best talent have always plagued the HR field. The chapter discusses how artificial intelligence could transform HR to handle those problems. The study design consists of an exploratory sequential mixed-methods approach, relying on a comprehensive literature review of academic articles, company reports, and case studies. From this study, outcomes have been drawn that show how emerging technologies can further help improve HR processes and digital mentoring for supporting employee performance in the human-centric Industry 5.0 era. An organization can focus on employee performance and their engagement by integrating AI into digital mentoring. This will help to fill the gap in the existing knowledge through a literature review, professional comments, and practical examples of how AI ethically and effectively fits into HR strategies and the concept of digital mentoring. Where data privacy, ethics, and talent management are key focal areas of AI implementation in the US, in Europe, it is ethical issues and data privacy. In Asia, AI enhances productivity and also scales up mentoring programs. \u00a9 2025 by Heena Bhardwaj. All rights reserved.",

This bibliometric review examines the \u201cinfluence of artificial intelligence\u201d (AI) on \u201chuman resources management\u201d (HRM) literature, following the PRISMA protocol to identify knowledge gaps and guide future inquiry. Data from \u201cthe Scopus database\u201d is analyzed by VOSviewer software to visualize the research landscape. By analyzing publication trends, citation networks, and thematic clusters, this review uncovers key research themes, influential authors, and emerging directions in AI-HRM studies. The results highlight the growing integration of AI knowledge in HRM practices, showcasing both their potential advantages and the challenges they pose. The key themes center on talent acquisition, performance analytics, ethical concerns, and decision-making automation. Influential authors and sources were mapped, and emerging research frontiers identified. The study concludes that AI is reshaping HRM practices, but ethical, legal, and human-centered implications remain underexplored. Future research should address cross-cultural perspectives, long-term impacts on workforce dynamics, and the development of inclusive AI systems in HRM. This thorough analysis provides valuable understandings for practitioners, policymakers, and researchers, supporting the development of AI-driven HRM strategies and developing a deeper consideration of AI\u2019s evolving role in the workplace. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2025.

    "abstract": "With the growing integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into human resource (HR) management, organizations are increasingly interested in how AI technologies can transform recruitment practices. This study examines the mechanisms through which perceptions of AI use and perceived challenges shape recruitment outcomes, focusing on both the effectiveness and efficiency of recruitment tasks. Drawing on data collected from HR professionals and managers working in recruitment roles in Saudi Arabia, the research explores the conceptual understanding of AI within the recruitment process and its implications for automating and enhancing HR functions. The analysis centers on mediation and moderation models to clarify the pathways linking AI use, trust, perceived challenges, and recruitment outcomes. In particular, the study investigates how trust in AI mediates the relationship between AI use and perceived recruitment benefits, as well as between perceived challenges and expectations for the future adoption of AI in recruitment. Furthermore, the study tests whether perceived challenges moderate the impact of AI use on recruitment benefits, thereby providing a comprehensive view of how confidence in and barriers to AI influence organizational adoption and outcomes. The findings reveal that trust in AI is a critical mediator, with AI use and perceived challenges influencing recruitment benefits and future expectations primarily through their effects on trust. Direct effects of AI use and challenges on recruitment benefits and anticipated future adoption were not significant when trust was accounted for, underscoring the central role of confidence in AI systems. Moderation analysis found no significant evidence that the effect of AI use on recruitment benefits is conditioned by perceived challenges. These insights highlight the need for organizations in Saudi Arabia to prioritize building trust and addressing barriers in order to fully realize the transformative potential of AI-driven recruitment. \u00a9 2025 NSP Natural Sciences Publishing Cor.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) applications transform public sector decision-making. However, most research conceptualizes AI as a form of specialized decision-support tool. In contrast, this study presents a different form of human-AI collaboration, the concept of human-AI ensembles, where public managers and AI tackle the same decision tasks, rather than specializing in certain subtasks. This is particularly relevant for many public sector decisions, where neither human nor AI predictions have a clear advantage over the other. We illustrate this within the context of public hiring, focusing on two key areas: (a) the potential of ensembling humans and AI to reduce biases and (b) the willingness of public managers to implement ensembling. Study 1 uses data from the assessment of profiles of real-life job candidates (n = 695) at the intersection of gender and ethnicity by public managers compared to AI. The exploratory linear regression results illustrate how ensembled decision-making may alleviate ethnic biases. The linear regression results of study 2, a preregistered survey experiment, show that public managers (n = 538 with four observations each) put equal weight on AI advice and human advice, and, when reminded of the unlawfulness of hiring discrimination, may even prioritize AI over human advice. \u00a9 2025 The Author(s).

Furthermore, the study examines the influence of AI knowledge and frequency of use on perceptions. An online survey was administered to a purposive sample of 420 HR managers working in the chemical industry in Saudi Arabia, and 234 complete responses were received. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, one-way ANOVA, and structural equation modeling. Findings show that AI was perceived positively, particularly in salary management, recruitment, performance evaluation, and training, but there were concerns about the loss of jobs and privacy. HR managers with higher education had a higher positive perception towards recruitment, selection, training, and performance appraisals. Knowledge and frequency of AI use had a positive influence on performance appraisal, recruitment and selection, and training, but had no influence on compensation and rewards. This study contributes to the literature by investigating perceptions of HR managers in the Saudi Arabia context. This is especially relevant in the context of technological advancement and Vision 2030 ambitions. Specifically, AI has the potential to create a skilled workforce eager for green innovation. \u00a9 2025 by the authors.",

The study identifies key research themes, theoretical frameworks, global research trends, and sectoral differences in HRM 4.0 adoption using performance analysis, science mapping, and network visualization. The findings reveal a rapid increase in HRM 4.0 research post-2020, with AI-driven HRM, digital talent management, and automation emerging as dominant themes. Geographic disparities indicate that China, the USA, and India lead research production, whereas Europe exhibits stronger international collaborations. Sectoral variations highlight faster adoption in technology and finance, while healthcare and public sectors lag due to regulatory and ethical concerns. The study also uncovers biases in AI-based HRM processes, emphasizing the need for transparent and explainable AI models to mitigate algorithmic discrimination. This study contributes by offering a comprehensive, systematized analysis of HRM 4.0 and highlighting critical ethical, strategic, and implementation challenges. Unlike prior fragmented reviews, it integrates both bibliometric trends and qualitative insights, providing trends for future research. The findings offer practical implications for policymakers, HR professionals, and researchers navigating the complexities of digital workforce transformation. \u00a9 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025.",

    "abstract": "This paper reviews the transformative role of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) in Human Resource (HR) management, from a practice perspective, highlighting both opportunities and challenges and laying out a use-inspired future research agenda. This scoping review is grounded in insights from a unique Summit held in Spring 2024, which brought together HR academic scholars with dozens of Fortune 500 Chief Human Resource Officers (CHROs) and their top technical leaders to discuss the workforce implications of GenAI. The paper identifies six key themes from the Summit practitioners: GenAI as disruptive and transformative, data as competitive advantage, adoption challenges, potential ethical abuses, the experimentation imperative, and the critical role of CHROs. These six themes provide a foundation for future research directions, which are discussed regarding six functional HR areas: recruitment and selection, training and development, performance management, job and work design, talent management, and compensation and benefits. The research agenda in each area emphasizes the need for academic researchers to understand and address the practical challenges posed by GenAI. Overcoming these substantive challenges will demand meaningful effort and a keen willingness to learn, on the part of both HR leaders and scholars. The paper concludes with a call to action for management scholars to engage in use-inspired research that bridges the gap between academic knowledge and practical HR challenges. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2025.",

    "abstract": "This article examines the strategic integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in human resource management (HRM), highlighting both its opportunities and its challenges. While AI can improve HRM functions such as recruitment, performance evaluation and employee development, it also raises concerns related to algorithmic bias, technostress and resistance to change. To navigate these complexities, we present a structured two-tiered model that balances algorithmic efficiency with human-centred workforce development. Unlike previous studies that explore AI-driven human resource management in isolation, this research provides a comprehensive strategy for AI adoption that improves employee engagement, optimises HR decision-making and fosters organisational resilience. In addition to outlining the role of AI in human resource management, we explore its practical implications, ethical considerations and associated risks, offering strategies to mitigate bias, promote transparency and foster organisational readiness for AI-driven transformation. We also emphasise the importance of pilot studies and empirical validation to assess the model's effectiveness in diverse organisational contexts. By providing a structured roadmap for AI integration, this study contributes to the ongoing discourse on how human resource management can lead, rather than simply adapt to, AI-driven workforce transformation. \u00a9 2025 The Author(s)",

The findings reveal four main shadow experiences associated with AI-based HRM systems, including the erosion of interpersonal autonomy, surveillance-induced precarity, algorithmic bias dilemma, and personalized discontentment. These experiences contribute to three distinct categories of well-being shadows: psychological alienation, physical adaptive overload, and social marginalization. This study clarifies the complex mechanisms linking shadow experiences to well-being outcomes and identifies enablers that can mitigate adverse effects, such as agility and personal growth, streamlined efficiency and harmony, and resource empowerment and engagement. It also proposes actionable pathways for employees to address and overcome these shadows, including deepened introspection, empowered inner power, and refined resourcefulness. The findings provide novel insights into the dual-edged nature of human-AI interaction and offer insights for promoting sustainable well-being in the evolving workplace environment. \u00a9 2025 The Authors",

    "abstract": "To ensure research transparency and methodological clarity, we provide additional details on our data sources, research design, and statistical reporting. Given the involvement of real job candidates in an AI-AVI hiring process, all data were collected under strict confidentiality agreements, with only de-identified self-reported survey responses used for analysis. This study was conducted as part of a two-year funded research project (Project No. 110\u20132511-H-003-044-MY2), investigating the effects of AI-assisted Asynchronous Video Interviews (AI-AVI) on candidate impression management behaviors and interview anxiety in employment screening contexts. The research design included five mutually exclusive experimental conditions, with each participant randomly assigned to one of the following groups: Group 1: Non-AI-AVI (Control Group). Group 2: AI-AVI without interface manipulation (Baseline). Group 3: AI-AVI with a tangible interface (Avatar). Group 4: AI-AVI with an immediate interface (Chatbot). Group 5: AI-AVI with a transparent interface (Text-based AI explanation). The study was conducted in collaboration with a Professional Employer Organization (PEO), which facilitated all aspects of participant recruitment and experimental administration. The research team did not have direct access to participants' personal information, receiving only anonymized datasets consistent with predefined specifications. All data were securely transferred by the PEO in compliance with ethical guidelines and data protection standards. Given the sensitive nature of Impression Management (IM) behaviors and interview anxiety, the survey measuring these constructs was independently conducted by the research team. To maintain participant anonymity and ensure unbiased responses, email invitations distributed by the PEO directed candidates to the research team's independent online questionnaire system. Participants provided informed consent electronically within the survey system, confirming that responses would remain confidential and not shared with third parties, including the PEO. All data were fully anonymized prior to analysis. No interview transcripts were recorded or analyzed. Data processing was conducted to ensure completeness and accuracy, adhering to ethical standards and prioritizing participant privacy. In the original submission, the correlation coefficients among the four manipulated AI-AVI interface conditions were omitted from Table 3 due to the categorical and mutually exclusive nature of the experimental groups. Pearson correlations typically apply to continuous variables; here, conditions were dummy-coded (0/1), rendering direct correlation calculations statistically less meaningful (O'Grady & Medoff, 1988). O'Grady, K. E., & Medoff, D. R. (1988). Categorical Variables in Multiple Regression: Some Cautions. Multivariate Behavioral Research, 23(2), 243\u2013260. https://doi.org/10.1207/s15327906mbr2302_7 As described in the paper: \u201cThe intercorrelations among AI and the other variables were computed based on observations from the AI-AVI without the three interfaces and the non-AI-AVI group (Analogy 1). In contrast, the intercorrelations among tangibility, immediacy, transparency, and the other variables were computed solely based on observations from the AI-AVI groups (Analogies 2, 3, and 4).\u201d Therefore, the correlation coefficients were computed from 130 participants assigned to AI-based AVIs (Groups 2\u20135), excluding the non-AI-AVI condition (Group 1). The dummy coding for manipulated variables was: AI: AI interface presence (1) vs. none (0). Tangibility: Avatar presence (1) vs. none (0). Immediacy: Chatbot presence (1) vs. none (0). Transparency: Text-based AI explanation (1) vs. none (0). These groups were mutually exclusive; therefore, correlation coefficients among these dummy-coded variables should be interpreted with caution. Nonetheless, for transparency, we provide these coefficients in the revised Table 3, with the caveat regarding their interpretative limitations. This paper and Suen & Hung (2023) originated from the same two-year funded research project (Project No. 110\u20132511-H-003-044-MY2), conducted by the same research team and employing identical experimental interfaces and participant recruitment processes. However, the two studies differed substantively in their research questions, theoretical frameworks, hypotheses, dependent variables, and analytical approaches. Suen & Hung (2023), completed in 2022 and published in 2023, focused on candidates' cognitive and affective trust perceptions based on Trust in Automation Theory and Social Interface Theory. In contrast, the current study, conducted from 2022 to 2023 and published in 2024, specifically examined candidates' honest and deceptive impression management behaviors through Impression Management Theory and the Faking Likelihood Model. Therefore, although both studies share the same overarching research context and interface classification (as proposed by Suen & Hung, 2023), each uniquely contributes to theoretical and practical understandings of AI-driven hiring without redundancy. Key Differences Between This Paper and Suen & Hung (2023): [Table presented] Specifically, Suen & Hung (2023) focused on candidates' cognitive and affective trust perceptions in AI-based interview systems, contributing to the literature on trust in automation and social interface theory. In contrast, this study examined candidates' impression management behaviors under various AI interface conditions, providing novel insights that align with impression management and employment faking research. By explicitly adopting the interface classification framework proposed by Suen & Hung (2023), this study ensured conceptual coherence while advancing both theoretical and practical knowledge in AI-driven hiring contexts. Collectively, these two complementary studies provided comprehensive yet distinct contributions to understanding AI's role in asynchronous video interviews, without concerns regarding redundant or fragmented publication. \u00a9 2025 The Author(s)",

However, few studies have assessed the effects of AI applications on training needs. This paper proposes an innovative multilevel modeling in order to investigate Awareness, Attitude and Trust towards AI and their reflections on learning needs. In particular, it is shown how a machine learning variable selection algorithm can support the definition of the optimal subset of all relevant covariates with respect to the outcome variable and improve the multilevel model performance for estimating the probability of educational needs. Thus, starting from a complex web survey to European citizens distributed in eight countries, the estimation of a multilevel binary model, defined on the basis of covariates selected through the Boruta\u00a0random forest algorithm, is proposed. A discussion on the gender differences of the related estimated multilevel logit models is presented. A sensitivity analysis is also included in order to assess the prediction accuracy of the proposed multilevel logit modeling. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2025.",

This study systematically reviews the role of AI in leadership and workplace engagement over the last five years, utilizing bibliometric analysis and the PRISMA framework to identify key research trends, methodologies, and future research directions. The findings indicate that AI-driven applications, such as large language models (LLMs), generative AI, and machine learning (ML) systems, have significantly influenced leadership decision-making,human resource management (HRM), and employee engagement strategies. While AI has enhanced operational efficiency and predictive analytics, ethical concerns regarding bias, transparency, and data privacy remain prominent. Furthermore, the study highlights the shift from AI as a purely automation tool to a hybrid AI-human collaboration model, where AI complements rather than replaces human leadership. \u00a9 2026 by IGI Global Scientific Publishing.

    "abstract": "The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into organizational processes is reshaping how decisions are made, driving innovation, efficiency, and strategic adaptability. By leveraging large-scale data analysis, AI systems enhance decision-making across sectors, from operations to human resource management. However, this transformation also raises critical concerns around transparency, ethics, and social accountability, especially in areas involving high-stakes outcomes. Addressing these challenges is essential to ensure that AI-supported management practices are not only effective but also fair, trustworthy, and aligned with broader societal values. Transparency in AI-Assisted Management Decisions explores how AI supports management decisions and assesses the transparency of these decisions. It analyzes the role of transparency in the integration of AI systems into decision-making processes while examining its impact on trust and accountability. Covering topics such as employee behavior, human resource management, and telework management, this book is an excellent resourced for practitioners, business leaders, academicians, researchers, and more. \u00a9 2026 by IGI Global Scientific Publishing.

We present a real-world case study for humble AI in the domain of algorithmic hiring. Specifically, we evaluate virtual screening algorithms in a widely used hiring platform that matches candidates to job openings. There are several challenges in misrecognition and stereotyping in such contexts that are difficult to assess through standard fairness and trust frameworks; e.g., someone with a non-traditional background is less likely to rank highly. We demonstrate technical feasibility of how humble AI principles can be translated to practice through uncertainty quantification of ranks, entropy estimates, and a user experience that highlights algorithmic unknowns. We describe preliminary discussions with focus groups made up of recruiters. Future user studies seek to evaluate whether the higher cognitive load of a humble AI system fosters a climate of trust in its outcomes. \u00a9 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",

    "abstract": "Ranking algorithms play a pivotal role in decision-making processes across diverse domains, from search engines to job applications. When rankings directly impact individuals, ensuring fairness becomes essential, particularly for groups that are marginalised or misrepresented in the data. Most of the existing group fairness frameworks often rely on ensuring proportional representation of protected groups. However, these approaches face limitations in accounting for the stochastic nature of ranking processes or the finite size of candidate pools. To this end, we present hyperFA\u2217IR, a framework for assessing and enforcing fairness in rankings drawn from a finite set of candidates. It relies on a generative process based on the hypergeometric distribution, which models real-world scenarios by sampling without replacement from fixed group sizes. This approach improves fairness assessment when top-k selections are large relative to the pool or when protected groups are small. We compare our approach to the widely used binomial model, which treats each draw as independent with fixed probability, and demonstrate-both analytically and empirically-that our method more accurately reproduces the statistical properties of sampling from a finite population. To operationalise this framework, we propose a Monte Carlo-based algorithm that efficiently detects unfair rankings by avoiding computationally expensive parameter tuning. Finally, we adapt our generative approach to define affirmative action policies by introducing weights into the sampling process. \u00a9 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",

    "abstract": "In this work, we \"audit the audits,\"analyzing the documents produced pursuant to one of the United States' first enacted laws regulating the use of artificial intelligence in employment: New York City's Local Law 144. This law requires employers and employment agencies using certain types of automated tools to publish \"bias audits\"with statistics about how different sex and racial groups fare in the hiring process when the tools are used. We collect and conduct a comprehensive analysis of all Local Law 144 bias audits (N=116) made publicly available to our knowledge from the law taking effect in July 2023 until early November 2024, and describe the extensive challenges we faced in identifying, archiving, extracting information from, and ultimately analyzing these bias audits. We identify several ways that bias audits produced in accordance with Local Law 144 are incomplete evaluations of algorithmic bias, despite news coverage and characterizations by employers and vendors suggesting otherwise. We show that Local Law 144 bias audits are significantly hampered by several issues, including missing demographic data, opaque data aggregation, problematic uses of \"test data,\"and reliance on metrics that do not represent how automated hiring tools are used in practice. We analyze the reported results in Local Law 144 bias audits alongside the four-fifths rule often used as a measure for assessing adverse impact in employment contexts. Most audits do not report results that would not suggest violations of the four-fifths rule. Crucially, however, we show that these tools could often be in violation of the four-fifths rule when considering potential impacts of missing demographic data. We offer ten practical recommendations to strengthen future legislative efforts that mandate algorithm auditing in hiring and other areas, and contribute an open dataset and codebase for extracting and combining bias audit results to support future auditing efforts. \u00a9 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",

    "abstract": "Many rules and regulations in areas such as lending or hiring cast explanations as a safeguard against algorithmic discrimination. The underlying assumption is that, for a given model, individuals could inspect explanations of predictions to contest discriminatory outcomes or flag the model as biased. This is a common-sense assumption that is easy to comply with. However, it is also very difficult to corroborate because it relies on unverifiable causal assumptions about which variables constitute proxies, and how the proxies affect the outcome variable. In order to make accurate claims, individuals must assume what these relationships are and be able to detect the proxies and their influence on predictions from the explanations. In this work, we study whether explanations help users detect algorithmic discrimination. We formalize the problem of detecting discrimination and introduce a synthetic robot classification task with known discrimination labels, overcoming real-world limitations where ground truth is unknown. We then design a user study that validates participants' understanding of explanations, protected attributes, proxies, and their causal strength, and isolates the utility of explanations. Our results show that human experts cannot reliably use explanations to flag discriminatory predictions irrespective of how much information about the predictions they have. Because the reliability of detection is low even under idealized conditions, these findings underscore the need for alternative anti-discrimination safeguards in practical settings. \u00a9 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",

Participants (n = 456) underwent a mock interview assuming real-Time evaluation. We find those who partook an interview evaluated by emotion AI perceived significantly lower levels of justice than that evaluated by HR, with this relationship partially dependent on outcome favorability. Additionally, identity attributes (e.g., gender, race, disability) and privacy concerns significantly influenced the information disclosed and emotional labor exerted during the interview. We discuss practical implications for emotion AI use in job interviews as well as broader methodological implications for capturing real-Time engagement with AI systems. \u00a9 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",

    "abstract": "While the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have been studied in both Simplified and Traditional Chinese, it is yet unclear whether LLMs exhibit differential performance when prompted in these two variants of written Chinese. This understanding is critical, as disparities in the quality of LLM responses can perpetuate representational harms by ignoring the different cultural contexts underlying Simplified versus Traditional Chinese, and can exacerbate downstream harms in LLM-facilitated decision-making in domains such as education or hiring. To investigate potential LLM performance disparities, we design two benchmark tasks that reflect real-world scenarios: regional term choice (prompting the LLM to name a described item which is referred to differently in Mainland China and Taiwan), and regional name choice (prompting the LLM to choose who to hire from a list of names in both Simplified and Traditional Chinese). For both tasks, we audit the performance of 11 leading commercial LLM services and open-sourced models-spanning those primarily trained on English, Simplified Chinese, or Traditional Chinese. Our analyses indicate that biases in LLM responses are dependent on both the task and prompting language: while most LLMs disproportionately favored Simplified Chinese responses in the regional term choice task, they surprisingly favored Traditional Chinese names in the regional name choice task. We find that these disparities may arise from differences in training data representation, written character preferences, and tokenization of Simplified and Traditional Chinese. These findings highlight the need for further analysis of LLM biases; as such, we provide an open-sourced benchmark dataset to foster reproducible evaluations of future LLM behavior across Chinese language variants (https://github.com/brucelyu17/SC-TC-Bench). \u00a9 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",

Design/methodology/approach: Related literature concerning traditional Confucian philosophy and the power of Confucianism was examined. Key perspectives on this topic relating to smart technology were analyzed. Whether Confucian humanity could be used to promote ethical behavior and continuous improvement in the workplace in the Age of Robots was then discussed. Findings: Three propositions were made: humans can better coexist with artificial intelligence (AI) and robots if humanity is valued, cultivated and practiced; some concepts of traditional Confucian philosophy can be applied to support management, employees and organizations to go through the technology-driven social change; and managements and human resource professionals can be the change agent and adopt Confucian paradigm for employees\u2019 and organizational effectiveness in the Age of Robots. Research limitations/implications: Future research on human\u2013machine interactions and strategic plans to apply Confucian humanity on job restructuring in robotic workplace is recommended. Practical implications: For organizational development implication, human resource professionals may identify business opportunities, develop human\u2013machine interactions strategic plans, build out creative process and promote moral behaviors and ethical conduct with a growth mindset. Social implications: For corporate social responsibility, management and human resource professionals can upskill and reskill employees to develop talents, avoid technology unemployment and advance their human skills to be competitive in the robotic workplace. Originality/value: This study highlighted how human workers should work like a human, not as a robot, by building a lifelong character through a moral refinement process for self-fulfillment, social responsibility and social stability. \u00a9 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.",

This paper revisits the job characteristics model through the lens of self-determination theory, specifically in the context of algorithmic performance management. Non-routine work is inherently unpredictable, and individuals often struggle with prolonged uncertainty. However, automated interventions that help individuals make sense of their work in uncertain conditions may help overcome the challenges of non-routine work and increase worker performance. In a randomized, controlled experiment delivered in a novel online task environment, we find that automated, real-time feedback increases the perceived trustworthiness of an algorithmic performance rating under conditions of high task uncertainty. Our research demonstrates the potential of artificial intelligence to automate certain tasks in non-routine work environments that positively augment human work performance while simultaneously enhancing trust in these automated work systems. \u00a9 2025 The Authors",

Specifically, while limiting the scope to research in HRM, it aims to answer three questions that are relevant to the research community. The first question is whether research papers define the terms 'bias' and 'discrimination', and if so how. Second, given that there are different forms of bias and discrimination, the question is exactly which ones are being investigated. Are there any forms of bias and discrimination that are underrepresented? The third question is whether a negativity bias exists in research on bias and discrimination in the context of AI. The answers to the first two questions point to some research problems. The review shows that in a substantial number of papers, the terms 'bias' and 'discrimination' are not or hardly defined. Furthermore, there is a disproportionate focus among researchers on bias and discrimination related to skin tone (racism) and gender (sexism). In the discussion, we provide reasons why this is undesirable for both scientific and extratheoretical reasons. The answer to the last question is negative. There is a relatively good balance between research that zooms in on the positive effects of AI on bias and discrimination, and research that deals with AI leading to (more) bias and discrimination. \u00a9 The Authors",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) hiring systems (AHSs) are used by employers every day to screen and shortlist job candidates. Despite this, substantial gaps exist in our understanding of the real \u2013 as opposed to theoretical \u2013 risks of discrimination when these systems are deployed. This article reports on findings from qualitative empirical research investigating the use of AHSs by Australian employers. It demonstrates that the way in which these systems are operated in practice creates serious risks of algorithm-facilitated discrimination. This may arise from the data, the use of proxies, the system's implementation, new structural barriers, a failure to provide reasonable adjustments, or the facilitation of intentional discrimination. These findings are significant, make an original contribution to an emerging field of research, and are relevant in any jurisdiction where an AHS is in use. There is a lot at stake when such discrimination occurs; as one research participant acknowledged, a \u2018job application is literally a person's attempt to change their life with a new job\u2019. \u00a9 2025 The Author(s).

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used across human resource management (HRM) functions, yet successful integration is contingent upon these tools being trusted within the organizations. Whereas longstanding cognitive models of trust have been extended to technology and AI as references of trust, motivational influences on trust in technologies have been neglected thus far. However, the consideration of motivational drivers is particularly important to understand and predict different stakeholder views on trust in AI. We integrate cognitive frameworks of trust in AI with more recent approaches to trust motivation stemming from interpersonal trust research. Based on this new integrative model, we specify motivational drivers and cognitive processes for trust in AI for four separate HRM stakeholder perspectives: the employer, decision makers, decision targets, and HR professionals. Particularly, the perspective of HR professionals has been neglected so far, despite the fact that this group is often closely involved with the implementation of AI systems and may see considerable changes to their job tasks after AI adoption. We discuss the theoretical implications of the different stakeholder perspectives for future research and outline specific practical implications of our integrative model. \u00a9 2025 by Information Age Publishing.

In the Australian IT industry, AI adoption in HRM, specifically in employee management, is increasing rapidly. Quantitative data collection and analysis have been conducted for this research. Data was collected from social media groups. Although the initial pool of candidates was 456, a total of 257 responses were received. After filtering out incomplete and invalid responses, 216 responses were considered for analysis. The results showed that the most significant driver of acceptance of AI-based employee management in the Australian IT industry, which ensures corporate social responsibility, is perceived transparency, fairness, and training and development sessions to enhance AI-related knowledge. There is no significant relationship between privacy and security and employee acceptance of AI integration into the employee management system. The positional level of employees in the Australian IT sector itself is a driver of higher AI acceptance. It has been suggested that managers prioritize CSR-driven initiatives, such as enhancing perceived transparency and fairness through the implementation of ethical AI practices. Additionally, both higher-level and lower-level employees should be involved in AI implementation processes to increase their acceptance levels. \u00a9 2025 Conscientia Beam. All Rights Reserved.",

This chapter investigates how both deepening and addressing gender inequality can be achieved through the use of artificial intelligence. AI is critiqued by a variety of feminists who showed how AI works against marginalized women, such as in hiring, healthcare, and facial recognition. The global digital divide further hinders women's ability to access the AI advances. First, it is biased hiring tools, discriminatory facial recognition and labor market polarization where AI automation poses a threat to jobs that tend to be held by women. However, AI also offers opportunities for equity through inclusive design, gender-sensitive policies, and grassroots initiatives. Feminist Tech movements, bias mitigation tools, and gender-responsive regulations may hamper the digital divide. The chapter argues that intent from the start is required for AI equity governance to avoid exacerbating marginalization and help build a more just technological future. \u00a9 2025, IGI Global Scientific Publishing.

To investigate, we conducted a survey with 448 computer science students (young, current technology job-seekers) about perceptions of the procedural fairness of AEDTs, their willingness to be evaluated by different AEDTs, the strategies they use relating to automation in the hiring process, and their job seeking success. We find that young job seekers' procedural fairness perceptions of and willingness to be evaluated by AEDTs varied with the level of automation involved in the AEDT, the technical nature of the task being evaluated, and their own use of strategies, such as job referrals. Examining the relationship of their strategies with job outcomes, notably, we find that referrals and family household income have significant and positive impacts on hiring success, while more egalitarian strategies (using free online coding assessment practice or adding keywords to resumes) did not. Overall, our work speaks to young job seekers' distrust of automation in hiring contexts, as well as the continued role of social and socioeconomic privilege in job seeking, despite the use of AEDTs that promise to make hiring ''unbiased''. \u00a9 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",

This study applied a justice model of applicants' reactions, including formal characteristics, information given, and interpersonal treatment, to influence applicants' perceptions of AVIs. Data were collected from 380 individuals through online platforms. Participants took an AVI, were informed the interview would be scored automatically, and were rejected with either a consistency-centric (i.e., emphasizing the consistency of the selection process), opportunity-centric (i.e., emphasizing the flexibility of the process and the opportunity to perform), combined, or a simple message saying they did not score high enough. While the hypothesized main effects of explanations were not supported, the use of a combined explanation indirectly influenced organizational attraction, pursuit intentions, and recommendation intentions through perceptions of procedural justice and interpersonal treatment. This study underscores the importance of comprehensive rejection information to enhance applicant reactions to AVIs (A data transparency [Supporting Information S1: Table\u00a0S1] is provided). \u00a9 2025 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies focus on machine learning (ML) algorithms for predicting employee churn (ECn) to save probable economic loss, technology leakage, and customer and knowledge transference. However, can human resource professionals rely on algorithms for prediction? Can they decide when the process of prediction is not known? Due to the lack of interpretability, ML models' exclusive nature and growing intricacy make it challenging for field experts to comprehend these multifaceted black boxes. To address the concern of interpretability, trust and transparency of black-box predictions, this study explores the application of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) in identifying the factors that escalate the ECn, analysing the negative impact on productivity, employee morale and financial stability. We propose a predictive model that compares the best two top-performing algorithms based on the performance metrics. Thereafter, we suggest applying an explainable artificial intelligence based on Shapley values, i.e., the Shapley Additive exPlanations approach (SHAP), to identify and compare the feature importance of top-performing algorithms logistic regression and random forest analysis on our dataset. The interpretability of the predictive outcome unboxes the predictions, enhancing trust and facilitating retention strategies. \u00a9 2025",

    "abstract": "There are great forms of technological advancement attributed to the development of digital technologies, but there are emerging concerns. Of the young companies, the one that can be considered most worrisome is deepfake technology, involving the use of AI in the creation of fake audiovisual material. The viral nature of fake news displayed by the ways it is spread on social networks proves that this new phenomenon is a grave danger to knowledge and discourse production. This paper aims to identify the influential factors that determine the adoption of deepfake counter-measures in an organisation. It will also seek to identify how organisations can mitigate these advanced threats by adjusting construct awareness of deepfake technology, construct training in identifying deepfakes, perceived exposure, confidence in the human resource office policies, regularity of communication concerning deepfake threats, and perceived effects on employment security. The findings indicate that trust in HR policies and frequent communication about deepfake risks significantly influence the implementation of mitigation measures. These findings highlight the need to improve the tactical awareness of fostering a holistic cybersecurity culture that prioritises trust, understanding, and continuous learning to combat the evolving landscape of digital threats effectively. Improving the organisational readiness to defend against deepfake threats can also help organisations improve their security, credibility, and image in a connected economy. \u00a9 2025 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

    "abstract": "Purpose: Talent scouting is recognized as a vital activity for professional sports organizations to establish a competitive advantage on the field. It remains, however, an imperfect science marred with bias and stereotypes. Technology \u2013 such as data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) \u2013 is a promising avenue to deal with these issues. Yet, much like in the broader HRM literature, little is known about its ability to effectively alleviate bias and on how to successfully make it co-exist with human recruiters. Design/methodology/approach: In collaboration with a professional North American soccer (football) team, this experimental study investigates the impact of using AI-anonymized game footage on scouts\u2019 assessments. In addition to quantitative ratings, it uses a \u201cthink-aloud\u201d or verbal cognition methodology to capture changes in the scouts\u2019 assessments. Findings: The results demonstrate how a \u201cblind scouting\u201d approach stands to alleviate bias and leads to more robust scouting assessments. Namely, the findings indicate that using de-identified footage through AI increases the scouts\u2019 focus on tactical abilities and decreases observations on potentially problematic physiological considerations. Originality/value: This study provides valuable insights on scouts\u2019 cognition and moves past the prevailing AI vs Human dichotomy by demonstrating how the technology can improve processes without removing the need for experts. It also speaks to AI\u2019s benefits beyond cost or time savings and suggests other potential HRM-related applications for AI. \u00a9 2025, Emerald Publishing Limited.",

Design/methodology/approach: Systematic literature review of 65 articles indexed in Scopus and in the main specialized journals on family businesses. Findings: The integration of AI and algorithms, specifically in selection procedures, raises major questions and faces legal and ethical issues that affect employee performance, moral commitment and fairness in the processes. These aspects are important to ensure transparency, fairness and accountability as they provide insight into the practices of business families and how succession challenges such as the possibility of using signaling games and addressing gender biases and information asymmetries that have been reported in past research could be complemented by these actions. Research limitations/implications: The limitations of this research are mainly attributed to the exclusive use of a single database (Scopus), which could limit access to relevant literature; Furthermore, the exclusion of certain articles, despite focusing on prestigious journals on business families, may have overlooked relevant contributions; Furthermore, the 20-year scope of the literature review that ended in February and August 2024 omits subsequent publications that could have enriched the findings of this study. Originality/value: To the best of the author\u2019s knowledge, this study is the first of its kind to conduct a bibliometric analysis covering the line of successor selection and the process leveraged by new practices such as AI,\u00a0an aspect that has been little addressed in the literature. In addition, this work traces aspects of decision-making that may affect selection. The research is of great value since it allows to illustrate in a consistent way the relationship between the selection of executive successors and how it is affected by the different decision-making processes in families, which allows to identify research gaps and make strategic decisions regarding the management of successions in BFs. Furthermore, this research provides a framework for future research in this area. \u00a9 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.",

Findings: Our analysis of AI applications to the metaverse in the workplace sheds light on the ambivalent role of and potential trade-offs that may arise with this emerging technology. If used responsibly, the metaverse can enable positive changes concerning the future of work, which can promote DEI. Yet, the same technology can lead to negative DEI outcomes if implementations occur quickly, unsupervised and with a sole focus on efficiencies and productivity (i.e. collecting metrics, models etc.). Practical implications: Managers and HR leaders should try to be first movers rather than followers when deciding if (or, better, when) to implement metaverse capabilities in their organizations. But how the metaverse is implemented will be strategic. This involves choices concerning the degree of invasive/pervasive monitoring (internal) as well as make or buy decisions concerning outsourcing AI capabilities. Originality/value: Our paper is one among few (to date) that discusses AI capabilities in the metaverse at the intersection of the HR and information systems(IS) literature and that specifically tackles DEI issues. Also, we take a \u201cbalanced\u201d approach when evaluating the metaverse from a DEI perspective. While most studies either demonize or celebrate these technologies from an ethical and DEI standpoint, we aim to highlight challenges and opportunities, with the goal to guide scholars and practitioners towards a responsible use of the metaverse in organizations. \u00a9 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Scholars have highlighted personal interactions between employees and their leaders in an increasingly distributed and hybrid work environment as an essential mechanism that engages employees toward organizational goals. Enhanced employee engagement significantly contributes to sustained organizational performance and growth. While Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications in the HR domain are increasing, research to understand the implication of AI-based virtual assistants on enabling trust and managing human resources is, at best, limited. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on the social response theory and the social exchange theory, and based on a multi-source, time-lagged field study spanning over ten months, we investigated the impact of AI-based virtual assistants on employee attitudes, namely perception of fairness and employee engagement. Findings: The usage of AI-based virtual assistants is associated directly with employee engagement and indirectly through employees\u2019 perceptions of fairness. While employees\u2019 past performance moderates the relationship between perceived fairness and employee engagement, the interaction effect becomes non-significant with AI-based virtual assistants. Research limitations/implications: Our study contributes to the emerging literature on AI-based virtual assistants in HRM and employee engagement. The virtual assistants\u2019 use to enhance employee engagement emerges as an opportunity for task substitution and augmentation. Our study demonstrates that AI-based virtual assistants can enhance employee engagement and help build perceptions of fairness among employees. Originality/value: With the emerging importance of AI, there is an increasing interest in explaining human-computer interactions and their effect on employee engagement. Our study is among the early empirical studies examining the implications of AI-based virtual assistants on employee outcomes. \u00a9 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.",

Design/methodology/approach: On the basis of the best-quality and most influential journals, we conducted a systematic review of 120 articles from two databases (Web of Science and Scopus) to provide descriptive results and adopt a framework for deductive classification of the main topics. Findings: Inspired by the three ethical theories, we identified three thematic lines of enquiry for the debate on AI in R&S: (1) the utilitarian view: the efficient optimisation of R&S through AI; (2) the justice view: the perceptions of justice and fairness related to AI techniques; and (3) the rights view: the respect for legal and human rights requirements when AI is applied. Originality/value: This article provides a detailed assessment of the adoption of AI in the R&S process from the standpoint of traditional ethics theories and offers an integrative theoretical framework for future research on AI in the broader field of HRM. \u00a9 2024, Martina Mori, Sara Sassetti, Vincenzo Cavaliere and Mariacristina Bonti.",

These platforms are often considered neutral for not displaying freelancers\u2019 gender, race, and age, but recent studies have revealed mounting freelancer complaints of unfair treatment and discrimination stemming from the platforms\u2019 algorithms. Drawing from social dominance theory, this study contributes to the algorithmic HRM literature by uncovering an indirect algorithmic discrimination mechanism explaining bias in algorithmic rankings. By using an Upwork dataset of 44,167 freelancers and leveraging structural equation modeling, we find that the number of jobs completed through the platform mediates the effects of gender, race, and age on the platform's ranking, demonstrating discrimination against female, Black women, Asian, and younger candidates. The study's theoretical contributions to the algorithmic HRM literature, the methodological contribution of a novel AI picture analysis tool, and managerial implications for online freelancing platforms and HR departments are discussed. \u00a9 2025",

This study addresses this gap by developing a conceptual model to examine how AI-driven HRM impacts employee resilience and adaptive performance. Based on self-determination theory, the model proposes that employee exploration mediates the relationships between AI-driven HRM and employee outcomes. Additionally, trust in AI moderates these relationships. Two studies were conducted to test the hypotheses: Study 1 developed and validated a 12-item AI-driven HRM scale across three samples: 50 managers, 150 employees for exploratory factor analysis (EFA), and 150 employees for confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Study 2, with data from 274 US employees through a three-wave survey, explored the effects of AI-driven HRM on resilience and performance. Results from Study 2 supported all proposed relationships, thereby offering important implications for both theory and practice in the AI-driven HRM field. \u00a9 2025 The Author(s)",

    "abstract": "Employers increasingly use artificial intelligence (AI) to help screen job applicants. But the way algorithms are designed can make them highly susceptible to systematic biases against women in male-dominated fields, including the women who are best qualified for the jobs. Various methods for debiasing hiring algorithms are available to help ensure that the best-qualified men and women are all given fair consideration. However, little is known about which approach is most likely to appeal to applicants. To address this question, the author conducted a mock job application experiment that examined how decisions to apply for a competitive job differ depending on the debiasing approach used. The study showed that awareness of gender bias in an algorithm significantly deterred women from applying, including those who were most qualified for the job. It also demonstrated that all the debiasing approaches studied significantly increased the number of women applying without compromising the quality of the final applicant pool. An approach designed to give men and women an equal chance of being selected attracted the most female applicants and should be considered by employers who primarily wish to increase diversity in hiring. However, men and women in this study also perceived an algorithm that ignored gender as the fairest. Such gender-blind algorithms should be considered by employers who want to both improve numbers of female applicants and reinforce workers\u2019 perceptions that hiring practices are fair. \u00a9 Behavioral Science & Policy Association 2025.

However, there are concerns about employees\u2019 acceptance of AI and the literature on employee acceptance of AI is still in its infancy. To address this research gap, integrating justice theory, we investigate the effects of the deciding entity (human, human and AI, and AI) and the impact of the data source (internal data, external data), on employees\u2019 reactions. Using a scenario-based between-subject design, displaying a common situation in organizations (N = 280) and an additional causal-chain-approach (N = 157), we examined whether a decrease of human involvement in decision making diminishes employees\u2019 perceived fairness and satisfaction with the career development process and increases their perceived privacy intrusion. Although we also considered other data sources to moderate the proposed relationships, we found no support for interaction effects. Finally, fairness and privacy intrusion mediated the influence of the deciding entity and data source on turnover intention and employer attractiveness, while satisfaction with the process did not. By addressing how the employees react to AI in career development\u2013showing the negative reactions, our study holds considerable relevance for research and practice. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2024.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) and human resources (HR) are frequently portrayed as opposing forces in academic discourse. Current rhetoric often frames AI as a potential threat to contemporary HR practices. AI is expressed as the capacity of machines to execute cognitive functions like perception, reasoning, and problem-solving typically associated with human cognition. However, research indicates that qualities like emotions, tacit knowledge, ethics, common sense, and pro-social behaviour are intrinsic human attributes that cannot be replicated by any intelligent machine. Therefore, this study argues that organizations cannot achieve optimal effectiveness by positioning AI and human employees at opposite ends of the spectrum. While numerous instances exist where specific human-AI collaborations address different organizational requirements, the reverse scenario of formulating general human-AI proposals based on specific organizational needs is less prevalent in the literature. \u00a9 2025 by IGI Global Scientific Publishing.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: This study aims to investigate the configurational effects of five rules \u2013 artificial intelligence (AI)-based hiring decision transparency, consistency, voice, explainability and human involvement \u2013 on applicants' procedural justice perception (APJP) and applicants' interactional justice perception (AIJP). In addition, this study examines whether the identified configurations could further enhance applicants' organisational commitment (OC). Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on the justice model of applicants' reactions, the authors conducted a longitudinal survey of 254 newly recruited employees from 36 Chinese companies that utilise AI in their hiring. The authors employed fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to determine which configurations could improve APJP and AIJP, and the authors used propensity score matching (PSM) to analyse the effects of these configurations on OC. Findings: The fsQCA generates three patterns involving five configurations that could improve APJP and AIJP. For pattern 1, when AI-based recruitment with high interpersonal rule (AI human involvement) aims for applicants' justice perception (AJP) through the combination of high informational rule (AI explainability) and high procedural rule (AI voice), there must be high levels of AI consistency and AI voice to complement AI explainability, and only this pattern of configurations can further enhance OC. In pattern 2, for the combination of high informational rule (AI explainability) and low procedural rule (absent AI voice), AI recruitment with high interpersonal rule (AI human involvement) should focus on AI transparency and AI explainability rather than the implementation of AI voice. In pattern 3, a mere combination of procedural rules could sufficiently improve AIJP. Originality/value: This study, which involved real applicants, is one of the few empirical studies to explore the mechanisms behind the impact of AI hiring decisions on AJP and OC, and the findings may inform researchers and managers on how to best utilise AI to make hiring decisions. \u00a9 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",

This study examines the influence of organizational resources on AI adoption in recruitment, focusing on their role in achieving competitive advantage through effective implementation. Design/methodology/approach: This research utilizes a cross-sectional quantitative approach, applying partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) to data from 290 human resource (HR) professionals. It is grounded in the resource-based view (RBV) and dynamic capability framework (DCF). Findings: The results reveal that HR competencies and open innovation significantly influence dynamic capabilities, which are essential for AI integration, supported by financial support and information technology (IT) infrastructure. These capabilities enable effective AI adoption, leading to a competitive advantage. Research limitations/implications: The cross-sectional data in this study captures the current landscape of AI adoption in recruitment, providing a snapshot of the present scenario in a rapidly evolving technological environment. Practical implications: This study offers HR professionals and managers strategic guidance on effectively integrating AI into recruitment processes. By enhancing HR competencies, fostering collaboration and ensuring sufficient financial and infrastructural support, organizations can navigate AI adoption challenges and secure a competitive advantage in a rapidly evolving technological landscape. Social implications: The adoption of AI in recruitment can reduce biases, enhance diversity and improve fairness through standardized assessments. However, as AI technologies evolve, continuous human oversight is essential to ensure ethical use and to modify AI systems as needed, further reducing biases and addressing societal concerns in AI-driven recruitment processes. Originality/value: This research introduces a novel framework that underscores the importance of integrating human expertise with advanced technological tools to ensure successful AI implementation. A key contribution is that HR professionals not only facilitate AI integration but also ensure accuracy, accountability and configure the most suitable AI tools for recruitment by collaborating with AI developers to meet the specific needs of the organization. \u00a9 2025, Emerald Publishing Limited.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Digital platform work monitored by algorithms is increasingly supplementing or substituting standard employment. Though gig workers are faced with the vulnerable, fragile and precarious digital platform work environment, the reason why gig workers remain highly willing to show good task performance has been so far unexamined. Building upon the reciprocity of the social exchange theory, this study aims to explore the antecedents and boundary condition of facilitating gig workers\u2019 task performance. Design/methodology/approach: First, to minimize common method variance, decline spurious mood effects and ensure data robustness, we conducted a two-wave time-lagged survey and collected 269 survey responses from gig workers on different gig platforms in China (e.g. Meituan, Eleme, Didi, Credamo, Zaihang) at two time nodes. Second, abiding by two stage procedures of the PLS-SEM (partial least square structural equation model) approach, we analyzed a moderated mediation model in the digital platform work context. Findings: Results present that both platform work remuneration and flexibility help gig platforms develop an affective trust relationship with gig workers, thus encouraging them to repay the platform by performing platform tasks well. Algorithmic monitoring shows a \u201cdouble-edged sword\u201d moderating role since it weakens the indirectly positive relationship between platform work remuneration and task performance via affective trust but enhances the indirectly positive relationship between platform work flexibility and task performance via affective trust. Practical implications: Understanding the importance of remuneration and flexibility in developing affective trust can help platforms design effective human resource management (HRM) strategies that enhance worker motivation of maintaining high engagement and performance under precarious working conditions. Additionally, optimizing the \u201cdouble-edged sword\u201d moderating role of algorithmic monitoring makes it more humanized, enhancing the efficiency with these HRM strategies and making both workers and platforms beneficial. Originality/value: These findings offer an affective trust-based explanation for the mechanism of maintaining high work performance motivation in the nonstandard and precarious employment from the social exchange perspective, while understanding the (de)humanized aspect of algorithmic monitoring by revealing its \u201cdouble-edged sword\u201d moderating role. \u00a9 2025, Emerald Publishing Limited.",

    "abstract": "When selecting top candidates for a job, organizations would prefer to not accidentally filter out the highest quality candidates. But an unbiased, detailed assessment of every applicant in a large candidate pool has been prohibitively costly. Asynchronous video interviews (AVIs) are inspiring new ideas for predicting job performance early in the hiring process by providing a rich source of signals. We propose that automatic analysis of interview data can improve candidate filtering at the application stage. The potential of this approach is clear, but there is a need for a structured framework and benchmarks to develop effective and valid application systems. We therefore propose a design framework that enhances the objectiveness of automated candidate assessment using AVIs through principles such as using behavioral cues that are hard to fake and using unbiased, validated labels in training sets. We demonstrate the implementation of this framework and evaluate its potential by building a prototype for automatically assessing general mental ability, an important and generalizable indicator of job performance. Results show that if new application systems adhere to this framework, more objective measures of job performance can be assessed automatically from AVI recordings. More generally, the study guides advancement of automated AVI platforms with a focus on efficacy and fairness. \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.",

    "abstract": "This comparative study between New Zealand and India was designed to explore applicants\u2019 perceptions of the AI-based hiring process. Some research explored different aspects of AI-based hiring processes, however, job applicants\u2019 experiences and perceptions, specifically in culturally distinct contexts, were under-investigated. Recognising the differences between New Zealand and India in terms of technological adoption rates and cultural backgrounds, this study addresses this gap by comparing applicant perspectives on AI-based hiring processes. This study undertook a survey to gather primary data using a questionnaire to collect data from targeted populations. The findings of this study suggest that the use of AI tools in recruitment is efficient and enhances the recruitment process. Participants also believe that AI-based hiring enhances the candidate selection process, and many respondents believe that AI tools can reduce bias. Interestingly, applicants from New Zealand expressed a stronger belief than Indian applicants that AI could effectively reduce bias in the process. This study provides insights into the implications of AI-driven recruitment processes and recommends that organisations specifically focus on their approaches in local contexts to optimise candidate experience. This cross-cultural comparison provides an in-depth understanding of the perception and adoption of AI-based hiring processes. Additionally, this study contributes to further understanding of AI\u2019s global impact and possible challenges in diverse global markets. However, it is important to note that this is an emerging field, and scenarios change all the time, so continuous research is needed. \u00a9 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.",

Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a qualitative approach, conducting semi-structured interviews with twelve learning and development (L&D) experts. Findings: This study indicates that ChatGPT can positively impact L&D by streamlining processes and potentially enhancing employee performance, engagement and satisfaction. However, to mitigate employee resistance, organizations must clearly communicate the necessity and rationale behind the change, involve employees in the implementation process and address trust issues. Key challenges such as overreliance on ChatGPT, AI skill shortages and technology issues like privacy breaches and misinformation must be managed through strong governance frameworks, including policies, guidelines and regular audits. Research limitations/implications: The study\u2019s scope is confined to semi-structured interviews with L&D experts, potentially limiting its generalizability. Further research could explore the long-term effects and broader implications of ChatGPT integration in different organizational contexts. Practical implications: By framing GenAI integration within the context of organizational change, this study offers insights into managing the transition effectively by providing guidance for managers on effectively integrating ChatGPT into L&D practices, emphasizing the importance of mitigating potential negative consequences while maximizing benefits. Social implications: Integrating ChatGPT into organizational L&D has the potential to reshape how employees acquire new skills and knowledge, potentially influencing organizational culture and dynamics. However, careful consideration is required to ensure that the integration process aligns with ethical and social norms, minimizing adverse impacts. Originality/value: This research contributes foundational insights into the integration of ChatGPT in corporate L&D by researching and understanding the opinions of corporate professionals. It serves as a starting point for organizations to identify challenges in adopting GenAI. \u00a9 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.",

When organisations start thinking about the experience of their employees as a factor that influences performance and turnover, sentiment analysis provides a quantitative way of measuring emotions, satisfaction and engagement of employees. This chapter attentions on several NLP techniques that can be employed in the analysis of the employee feedback which include tokenization, stop- word removal and vectorization. It also looks at how other machine learning models such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, and Long Short- Term Memory can be used to categorize emotions as positive, negative, or neutral. In addition, the problem of language, culture, and data bias is described, and the ways to solve them are also described. The future potential of the real- time emotion analysis and the use of sentiment data along with the organizational KPIs for improving the management of employees' experience is depicted. \u00a9 2025, IGI Global Scientific Publishing.

    "abstract": "Along with providing extraordinary benefits, artificial intelligence (AI) poses risks of harm to people. This article focuses on two ethical concerns with AI that are of particular concern to consulting and industrial\u2013organizational psychologists: harm to people\u2019s well-being and harm to interpersonal relationships. AI has the ability to affect people\u2019s perceptions and experiences when they interact with each other in AI-mediated communication by rewriting and autocorrecting people\u2019s writing, changing physical appearances, and redirecting people\u2019s attention to information or ideas that could marginalize or create bias against people. AI is also able to influence people\u2019s ways of thinking and feeling in human\u2013AI interaction. It can cause them to react more positively or negatively to information and to anthropomorphize AI using different types of imagery and language patterns. When AI is used in automated performance-management platforms, it can direct employees to work harder and longer than they want to and cause harm through stress and burnout. Many codes of ethics require consultants and professionals to take reasonable steps to avoid harming the clients and people with whom they work and to minimize harm where it is foreseeable and unavoidable. This article identifies how these AI capabilities may cause harm to individual, interpersonal, and group well-being even when the same AI may also provide positive contributions. It provides guidance for consulting and industrial\u2013organizational psychologists to research, create, and deploy AI in healthy ways and mitigate harm to employees. \u00a9 2025 American Psychological Association",

Based on interviews with twenty-four expert recruiters, the purpose of the study is to explore their professional views and expectations concerning the present-future impact of AI on personnel selection. The study seeks to shed new light on the exponential increase in meta-algorithmic judgments, a concept that pinpoints the fact that many experts today must handle algorithmic assessments before moving forward in the decision-making process. What do the respondents think has motivated this socio-technological change, and what do they expect will happen to the role of human judgment in the future? The analysis suggests that the seemingly inevitable existence of human biases and the lack of efficiency in traditional recruitment are, according to all respondents, the main reasons why AI should be used, given its promise to improve both fairness and time management. While AI recruitment systems will most likely become increasingly sophisticated, most respondents thought that these systems would nevertheless never be able to fully replace human judgment. However, a handful of respondents deviated from this majority view by instead expecting that AI would take over the whole process in the not-too-distant future. \u00a9 2025 The Authors",

    "abstract": "Gender diversity training is typically provided to mix-gender audiences. This one-size-fits-all approach may be suboptimal because information about gender bias and inequity is often received differently along gender lines: men are less likely than women to believe it. We argue for tailoring gender diversity training via implementing segmentation and tailoring algorithms in training systems. To develop our theorizing, we integrate a learner-centric approach to diversity training with principles of jiu jitsu persuasion theory. This leads us to test a new approach to diversity training that involves dynamic adaptation and tailoring the training to learners. Specifically, we first identify two distinct segments of men\u2014believers and skeptics\u2014and develop a user-friendly segmentation algorithm that segments men, in real time, using only five items (Study 1). We then use the algorithm to assign segments of men trainees to tailored or non-tailored training and show that presenting skeptic men with a tailored message improves training reactions and increases intentions to support gender diversity efforts (Study 2). Thus, we show that dynamic adaptation and tailoring successfully explain training outcomes, particularly for trainees who are skeptical of the diversity message. Practically, our study demonstrates the functionality and value of segmentation algorithms for organizations' training systems. \u00a9 2024 International Association of Applied Psychology.",

    "abstract": "Sourcing algorithms are technologies used in online platforms to identify, screen, and inform potential applicants about job openings. The popularity of such technologies is rapidly increasing due to their pervasiveness in online advertising and beliefs that sourcing algorithms can decrease time to hire while improving the quality of new hires. What is little known, however, are their potential risks: sourcing algorithms could (intentionally or unintentionally) encode or exacerbate occupational demographic disparities, thereby hindering organizational diversity and/or decreasing the effectiveness of online hiring practices. Because sourcing algorithms identify and screen potential job applicants before they are made aware of employment opportunities, methods for evaluating discrimination in hiring which focus solely on job applicants (e.g., adverse impact ratio), may fail to detect the effects of discriminatory sourcing algorithms. Thus, we propose an expanded model of the employee hiring process to take into account the role of sourcing algorithms. Based on empirical approximations, we conducted a Monte Carlo simulation study to examine the magnitude and nature of sourcing algorithms' influence on hiring outcomes. Our findings suggest that sourcing algorithms could hinder the diversity of new hires while misleadingly suggesting positive diversity outcomes in personnel selection. We provide practical guidance for the use of sourcing algorithms and call for a systematic re-examination of how to evaluate selection system fairness in the era of algorithmic recruitment. \u00a9 2024 The Author(s).

Academic literature in relation to AI acceptance in HR functions is currently limited, so this paper aims to establish a better understanding of the current landscape and level of ambition in this area. Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative research approach was adopted to determine likely behavioral intentions of workers in the human resource (HR)function if AI were implemented, by investigating key aspects of the TAM (the perceived usefulness of AI and the transparency of the CSHR in adopting AI). Findings: While the results suggest that the CSHR is not ready to harness AI opportunities, employees were personally ready, despite perceiving a lack of sufficient knowledge in this area. The paper identifies that more time needs to be spent on raising awareness and upskilling the HR function before the CS can be considered fully ready to harness these opportunities. Originality/value: The penetration of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies into the global workforce brings transformative potential to the governance structures and use of digital platforms in public sector organizations.

However, the candidate perspective on AI usage remains underexplored, as existing research predominantly focuses on the employer's viewpoint. Addressing this gap, we conducted a vignette survey experiment to examine how the combination of AI with professional and personal digital data influences the perceptions of business and engineering candidates regarding organizational attractiveness (OA) and their likelihood to apply for a job. The study was conducted in two large European Union (EU) countries, providing insights specific to the EU context, where regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation and the AI Act lead global efforts on responsible AI use. Our findings indicate that candidates generally view AI positively, particularly valuing its role in fostering innovation and development. Nevertheless, the combination of AI with professional and personal data prompts a more cautious perspective among candidates, with some opting not to apply. Notably, engineering candidates displayed more significant reservations towards AI than their business counterparts, contrasting to prior research. This investigation enriches theoretical, methodological, and practical discussions concerning AI in recruitment, elucidating factors influencing candidate perceptions and suggesting avenues for future research. \u00a9 2025 The Authors",

    "abstract": "The present article identifies four types of data that can be analyzed using artificial intelligence- (AI-) powered hiring tools assessments in various stages of the selection process: (a) data from traditional psychometric instruments, (b) data from AI-based assessment tools, (c) data from the \u201cdigital footprint\u201d of given individuals, and (d) direct and indirect observations. In all methods, AI makes predictions and supports hiring/promotion decisions using historic data (\u201ctraining data\u201d). Understanding both the nature of these data and the underlying functionality of the AI is crucial when it comes to evaluating ethical and legal issues that might arise when employing AI in assessments, such as discrimination and inequities. Questions addressed here include the following: (1) Does a bias already exist in the data on which the AI system has been trained? (2) Does the algorithm have parameters based on psychological theories and evidence? (3) Does the AI system allow the \u201cblack box\u201d to be opened? The article also notes that AI-driven assessments have the potential to deliver more precise evaluations of individuals. Additionally, because these assessments rely on a wealth of data and on numerous interactions drawn from real-life circumstances, they can address typical rather than merely maximal behavior, with the typical case capable of being measured via psychometric tests. The article furthermore discusses a number of ethical issues that arise in personnel selection using AI. \u00a9 2025 American Psychological Association",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to dramatically change the human approaches to work, and specifically to learning and development. While AI coaching can reduce costs and increase accessibility, it also presents both opportunities and threats to human coaches. The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic literature review of peer-reviewed research on the use of AI in coaching. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature review (SLR) method was used to search eight databases for articles produced up to March 2024. Data extraction was conducted, with Quality Assessment undertaken independently, in parallel, using two researchers and a third arbiter. The ROBINS-I tool was used to assess the risk of bias in the included studies. A narrative synthesis of a total of 16 quantitative, qualitative or mixed-method studies covering n\u00a0=\u00a02312. Findings: The SLR identified four key themes: Research design and AI integration, AI usefulness in coaching, impact of AI coaching and ethical considerations. The findings suggest that AI coaches can be effective, accepted, useful and match human coaches in competence for specific tasks. Practical implications: AI coaching is a growing area of practice and research. This paper brings together the literature and identifies future research priorities and potential next steps in AI coach development. Originality/value: The paper uses clinical research SLR methods applying these robust processes to the field of organisational research, to set a new standard through the use of a pre-determined research protocol, quality assessment and ROB, well providing a comprehensive literature review of AI coaching. \u00a9 2025, Jonathan Passmore, Bergsveinn Olafsson and David Tee.",

A systematic literature review (SLR) is conducted using an original approach, embedding an AI stage to carry out a systematic literature review in academic papers that highlight the challenges and opportunities arising for HR in the context of industrial revolutions. The findings emphasise the need for companies to invest in training and development programmes for employees to work alongside automated systems. Integrating Industry 4.0 technologies also necessitates re-evaluating traditional HRM (HR Management) practices, requiring a shift towards data-driven decision-making, upskilling, and reskilling initiatives. The review underscores the important role of HR in promoting sustainable and cross-sectoral practices and addressing ethical and legal implications of HR technology. The research findings provide insights for HR practitioners and policymakers in navigating the challenges and opportunities of Industry 4.0. The review also identifies avenues for future research, including investigating the impact of Industry 4.0 technologies on employee well-being, studying the intersection of sustainability and HRM, conducting cross-cultural studies, and exploring the evolution of HRM in the digital age. \u00a9 2025 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

    "abstract": "The advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Human Resource (HR) practices is fundamentally transforming the management of talent and the optimization of workforce efficiency, particularly in the context of Indian universities. As AI-driven systems increasingly shape HR decisions, there is a pressing need to evaluate their impact on employee well-being, a crucial yet often overlooked aspect. This research paper provides a critical analysis of the ethical implications associated with the deployment of AI in HR practices within Indian academic institutions, with a specific focus on employee well-being. The study investigates key areas where AI is being utilized, including talent acquisition, performance assessment, and employee surveillance, and assesses how these applications influence the psychological, emotional, and professional well-being of university staff. By incorporating contemporary ethical frameworks and examining case studies from Indian universities, the paper illuminates both the potential benefits of AI\u2014such as personalized employee experiences and efficiency gains\u2014and the significant risks, including bias, privacy concerns, and job security issues.In response to these findings, the research proposes an ethical framework tailored to the Indian higher education context, aimed at guiding the responsible integration of AI into HR practices. This framework emphasizes the prioritization of employee well-being alongside institutional objectives, ensuring a balanced approach to AI adoption. The insights presented in this paper are intended to contribute to the broader discourse on ethical AI implementation in the workplace, offering valuable guidance for HR professionals, policymakers, and AI developers within Indian universities to foster a more humane and equitable work environment. \u00a9 2025, Creative Publishing House.

The study aims to construct and refine a dynamic knowledge graph that integrates cybersecurity job-seeking candidates, skills, and job opportunities, enabling efficient and equitable matching. Key supports include the graph-based algorithms ranking inspired by PageRank, prioritizing candidates based on skill relevance while accounting for objective factors such as location, experience, and diversity. The research also addresses fairness in recruitment by introducing bias-detection mechanisms within the graph structure, mitigating discriminatory practices in skill identification, job descriptions, and candidate profiling. Additionally, the framework incorporates feedback from the recruiter to continuously refine matching algorithms, ensuring adaptability to evolving hiring requirements. By leveraging fairness-aware graph algorithms, we proposed that the system aims to reduce the impact of biased training data on Human Resource (HR) decision-making while enhancing transparency and trust. The evaluation will measure improvements in candidate-job fit, recruitment efficiency, and participants' overall satisfaction.

    "abstract": "Purpose: The primary purpose of the study was to explore the impact of health workers\u2019 awareness of artificial intelligence (AI) on their workplace well-being, addressing a critical gap in the literature. By examining this relationship through the lens of the Job demands-resources (JD\u2013R) model, the study aimed to provide insights into how health workers\u2019 perceptions of AI integration in their jobs and careers could influence their informal learning behaviour and, consequently, their overall well-being in the workplace. The study\u2019s findings could inform strategies for supporting healthcare workers during technological transformations. Design/methodology/approach: The study employed a quantitative research design using a survey methodology to collect data from 420 health workers across 10 hospitals in Ghana that have adopted AI technologies. The study was analysed using OLS and structural equation modelling. Findings: The study findings revealed that health workers\u2019 AI awareness positively impacts their informal learning behaviour at the workplace. Again, informal learning behaviour positively impacts health workers\u2019 workplace well-being. Moreover, informal learning behaviour mediates the relationship between health workers\u2019 AI awareness and workplace wellbeing. Furthermore, employee learning orientation was found to strengthen the effect of AI awareness on informal learning behaviour. Research limitations/implications: While the study provides valuable insights, it is important to acknowledge its limitations. The study was conducted in a specific context (Ghanaian hospitals adopting AI), which may limit the generalizability of the findings to other healthcare settings or industries. Self-reported data from the questionnaires may be subject to response biases, and the study did not account for potential confounding factors that could influence the relationships between the variables. Practical implications: The study offers practical implications for healthcare organizations navigating the digital transformation era. By understanding the positive impact of health workers\u2019 AI awareness on their informal learning behaviour and well-being, organizations can prioritize initiatives that foster a learning-oriented culture and provide opportunities for informal learning. This could include implementing mentorship programs, encouraging knowledge-sharing among employees and offering training and development resources to help workers adapt to AI-driven changes. Additionally, the findings highlight the importance of promoting employee learning orientation, which can enhance the effectiveness of such initiatives. Originality/value: The study contributes to the existing literature by addressing a relatively unexplored area \u2013 the impact of AI awareness on healthcare workers\u2019 well-being. While previous research has focused on the potential job displacement effects of AI, this study takes a unique perspective by examining how health workers\u2019 perceptions of AI integration can shape their informal learning behaviour and, subsequently, their workplace well-being. By drawing on the JD\u2013R model and incorporating employee learning orientation as a moderator, the study offers a novel theoretical framework for understanding the implications of AI adoption in healthcare organizations. \u00a9 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.",

    "abstract": "Predictive Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms are being increasingly adopted by organizations to inform workforce-related decisions. However, their effectiveness could be undermined by a lack of ground-truth data, particularly concerning human perceptions of fairness in predictive factors. This study examined 306 employees\u2019 perspectives on the fairness of 31 predictive features in five categories: demographic, academic, work-related, cognitive abilities and personality traits, and professional development and certification. Our findings revealed that employees generally regard features as fair when they align closely with job performance and contribute to prediction accuracy. Features related to technology usage attitude, workplace comfort, job rank satisfaction, alignment between one\u2019s field of expertise and work, years of service in the same field, and total work experience were the highest perceived fair predictors. Conversely, more participants tended to perceive features such as gender, marital status, and number of children as unfair due to concerns about their actual contribution to prediction accuracy, privacy implications, and the risk of bias and discrimination. Features pertaining to professional development and certification were considerably viewed as fair predictors. These findings are valuable for the development of fairer AI algorithms for predicting employee performance by ensuring that predictive features align with employee perceptions of fairness. \u00a9 2025 The Author(s).

This study explicitly tries to comprehend the significant theories, analytical methods, procedures, and essential aspects of recruiting evaluation. The study analyses 60 research articles using a systematic literature review procedure, and it summarises its conclusions using the theory-context-characteristics-methodology (TCCM) framework. This research shows a substantial change in talent acquisition strategies over the previous two decades. While tried and tested, traditional hiring practices have encountered several obstacles, such as lengthy manual screening processes, biases, and restricted access to a diverse candidate pool. AI-adopted recruitment is a possible alternative, delivering improved speed, impartiality, and customized applicant experiences. The paper offers a conceptual framework for future empirical research derived from the SLR and unique synthesis of TAM and RBV. By incorporating AI-assisted recruiting tools, emphasizing user-centered design, and allocating resources to artificial intelligence, organizations can improve their decision-making process. AI skills can be improved by HR personnel and training programs, and resource distribution ought to be based on perceived utility. This study adds to the body of knowledge on talent acquisition techniques and lays the groundwork for subsequent investigations into the changing function of AI in HR procedures. \u00a9 2025 The Author(s).

    "abstract": "The job applicant hiring process is inherently complex, encompassing various dimensions such as cultural fit, team dynamics, and individual qualifications. This paper explores the potential of machine learning techniques as analytical tools to examine the nuances of the hiring process rather than automating it. In this study, we use machine learning models to evaluate whether gender or age bias exists in hiring decisions by examining an extensive IT industry dataset comprising over 70,000 applicants. We provide practical guidelines for data preparation, bias evaluation, and assessment of AI-driven hiring outcomes, focusing on the influence of key factors on hiring probability. Our findings reveal that female applicants tend to receive lower hiring probabilities than male applicants, suggesting a gender-related bias. Additionally, we identify that proficiency in \u201cComputer Skills,\u201d the number of programming languages known, and familiarity with the language \u201cTypeScript\u201d\u2014introduced in 2012\u2014are among the top skills influencing hiring decisions. This study offers HR practitioners actionable insights into the AI decision-making process, highlighting how skills valued by AI models may differ from those prioritized in traditional recruitment. Through our empirical study, we demonstrate how multiple machine learning methods can be used for bias detection and the validation of critical decision factors in hiring decisions, equipping HR professionals with tools to enhance understanding and fairness in AI-driven hiring. \u00a9 2025 International Association for Computer Information Systems.",

Despite their growing use, our understanding of how people perceive such algorithms, particularly in terms of fairness, is less developed. Using Organisational Justice Theory, we explore how workers perceive the fairness of HR-decisions made by algorithms and how those perceptions impact job satisfaction and perceived organisational support (POS). Results from a survey of 435 Uber drivers indicate that perceptions of algorithmic fairness\u2013and their formation\u2013differ based on the type of HR-decision enacted by an algorithm and whether those decisions are considered to require mechanical or human skills. Results also demonstrate positive significant relationships between perceived algorithmic fairness, POS, and job satisfaction. This study answers calls to investigate perceptions of algorithmic fairness across different HR-decisions and their impacts in real-world settings. Our results suggest that algorithms play an important role in shaping platform-workers\u2019 experiences and attitudes as both technological artefacts and social agents of the organisation. Recommendations for improving the perceived fairness of algorithms for HR-decisions by focusing on transparency and high impact/value fairness indicators are offered. \u00a9 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

We focus on intimacy as a core social skill. Data were gathered from 94 applicants who completed an interview training session with an AI job interviewer that exhibited either multimodal expression of intimacy behaviors or no intimacy behaviors. Following the interaction, participants completed a questionnaire asking about their perceptions of intimacy, user experience, impression management and fairness. The findings demonstrate the reciprocity of intimacy behaviors and a positive user experience in the intimacy condition. By illustrating how AI job interviewers with social skills can affect the social relation established during a recruitment interview and provide satisfactory experiences, the present study offers promising avenues for improving the quality and effectiveness of human resource tools using AI devices, while also highlighting some managerial and ethical concerns. \u00a9 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: this research aims to explore the effectiveness and inclusivity of AI-powered recruitment tools in hiring people with disabilities within the United Arab Emirates. Such is the situation where AI integration into the arena of recruitment is increasingly rapid, while there are vital issues on the side of bias, accessibility, and fairness for applicants of diverse needs. Method: this study was a mixed-methods approach, examining sentiment analysis, emotion detection, and HR analytics of feedback from applicants with a disability, 415 in total. The research focused on scores referring to sentiment, the progression rate, and the outcome of the final hiring. Results: the sentiment score varied significantly across disability types (p-value <0,05). The applicants with cognitive disability expressed the highest sentiment sore while applicants with hearing impairment had the lowest, which indicated the varying adaptability of AI. The emotion analysis depicted a mix of positive and negative emotions. A few applicants liked technology and have trust in it, while others report fear. Clearly, the applicants, both disabled and non-disabled did not differ in their rate of progression (p-value >0,05), hence never indicating any significant difference within the initial steps of the process. The final hiring stage showed significant differences in results with (p-value <0,05), where the proportionate number of disabled applicants was recorded to be lower than that of non-disabled applicants. Conclutions: the findings have indicated that while AI-powered recruitment tools are efficient in nature, they are not very inclusive for applicants with diversifying disabilities. Regular audits of its biases, more inclusive designing of AI, and human oversight are some recommendations that go a long way in ensuring fairness and accessibility in AI-powered recruitment processes. \u00a9 2025; Los autores.",

    "abstract": "Background: Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the selection of residency program applicants is a new tool that is gaining traction, with the aim of screening high numbers of applicants while introducing objectivity and mitigating bias in a traditionally subjective process. This study aims to compare applicants screened by an AI software to a single Program Director (PD) for interview selection. Methods: A single PD at an ACGME-accredited, academic general surgery program screened applicants. A parallel screen by AI software, programmed by the same PD, was conducted on the same pool of applicants. Weighted preferences were assigned in the following order: personal statement, research, medical school rankings, letters of recommendation, personal qualities, board scores, graduate degree, geographic preference, past experiences, program signal, honor society membership, and multilingualism. Statistical analyses were conducted by chi-square, ANOVA, and independent two-sided t-tests. Results: Out of 1235 applications, 144 applications were PD-selected and 150 AI-selected (294 top applications). Twenty applications (7.3%) were both PD and AI selected for a total analysis cohort of 274 prospective residents. We performed two analyses: 1) PD-selected vs. AI-selected vs. Both and 2) PD-selected vs. AI-selected with the overlapping applicants censored. For the first analysis, AI selected significantly: more White/Hispanic applicants (p < 0.001), less signals (p < 0.001), more AOA honors society (p = 0.016), and more publications (p < 0.001). When censoring overlapping PD and AI selection, AI selected significantly: more White/Hispanic applicants (p < 0.001), less signals (p < 0.001), more US medical graduates (p = 0.027), less applicants needing visa sponsorship (p = 0.01), younger applicants (p = 0.024), higher USMLE Step 2 CK scores (p < 0.001), and more publications (p < 0.001). Conclusions: There was only a 7% overlap between PD-selected and AI-selected applicants for interview screening in the same applicant pool. Despite the same PD educating the AI software, the 2 application pools differed significantly. In its present state, AI may be utilized as a tool in resident application selection but should not completely replace human review. We recommend careful analysis of the performance of each AI model in the respective environment of each institution applying it, as it may alter the group of interviewees. \u00a9 2024 Association of Program Directors in Surgery",

    "abstract": "The emergence of gig economy has facilitated the adoption of algorithm-based management systems, creating favorable conditions for gig workers. Nevertheless, it also brings various challenges and uncertainties, especially gig workers' safety performance, having become a prominent concern. Based on ego-depletion theory, we investigate the underlying mechanism through which platform algorithmic control influences on safety performance of gig workers. Based on two points of data from 314 gig workers in China, we found that the three dimensions of algorithmic control (viz., standardized guidance, tracking evaluation and behavioral constraint) have differential effects on safety performance. On one hand, algorithmic standardized guidance is negatively related to ego-depletion, which in turn improves safety performance. On the other hand, algorithmic tracking evaluation and behavioral constraint are positively related to ego-depletion, and consequently reducing safety performance. Furthermore, algorithmic transparency moderates the relationship between algorithmic standardized guidance, algorithmic tracking evaluation, and ego-depletion; self-efficacy moderates the relationship between algorithmic standardized guidance and ego-depletion; both trait mindfulness and leadership safety commitment moderate the relationship between ego-depletion and safety performance. This study offers valuable insights for platform enterprises to optimize the effectiveness of algorithmic control. \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd",

    "abstract": "Automated employment decision tools use machine learning, artificial intelligence, predictive analytics, and other data-driven approaches to enhance candidate experiences and streamline employment related decision-making, allowing human resources to be concentrated where they are needed most. However, the use of these tools without appropriate safeguards has resulted in a number of high-profile scandals in recent years, particularly in regard to bias. Accordingly, lawmakers have started to propose laws that require bias audits of automated employment decision tools to examine their outputs for subgroup differences. The first of its kind was New York City Local Law 144, but other US states have since followed suit. In this paper, we examine the concerns about the effectiveness of this and other similar laws, including the suitability of metrics, the scope of the law, and low levels of compliance. We conclude that despite the law being a good initial first step towards greater transparency around automated employment decision tools and reducing bias, examining outcomes alone is not sufficient to prevent bias elsewhere in the tool. Moreover, effective bias prevention will require a multidisciplinary approach that combines expertise in IO psychology, law, and computer science to develop appropriate metrics and maximize the enforceability of such laws. \u00a9 2024 The Author(s).

Findings indicate that the adoption and effective use of GenAI services does not directly improve workplace performance. Instead, an optimal level of trust in these services plays a critical mediating role, enhancing work engagement and thereby performance. The study draws on the reviewed job demand-resources theory (JD-R) to construct a new theoretical framework of applied in GenAI services, offering insights into how user experience and trust influence engagement and productivity.

Findings show a persistent imbalance: 67% of worker narratives express negative emotions such as frustration, precarity, and stress, while institutional discourse emphasizes optimism, fairness, and transparency. A comparative view highlights diverse national responses, from Spain's Riders Law to cautious Eastern European approaches. Sentiment trends from 2023 to 2025 reveal a modest decline in negativity and slight rises in neutral and positive tones, reflecting cautious adaptation to EU reforms.

Through qualitative and thematic synthesis analysis of studies published between 2015 and 2025, the review finds that AI and e-HRM significantly strengthen strategic agility. However, challenges such as data privacy concerns, algorithmic bias, integration difficulties, and resistance to AI adoption may limit scalability and ethical use. While AI-driven tools offer strong potential for improving agility, addressing ethical, technical, and organizational challenges is crucial to fully realize their benefits. The findings highlight the need for policies supporting ethical AI practices, robust data governance, and workforce readiness to ensure effective integration of AI tools and strengthen organizational agility and real time decision-making. \u00a9: \u00a9 2025 Ongesa Nyamboga T.",

It examines the mediating role of AI\u2013employee collaboration (AEC), playful work design (PWD) and the moderating role of AI empathy, based on the resource-based view (RBV) and dynamic capability theory. Design/methodology/approach \u2013 In total, 302 workers in Vietnam\u2019s aviation sector participated in a quantitative, cross-sectional study. To evaluate a moderated mediation model, data were examined using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Findings \u2013 The results demonstrate that EOHRM significantly enhances employee creativity. This relationship is mediated by AEC and PWD, suggesting that these mechanisms are important pathways by which EOHRM promotes creative outcomes. Furthermore, AI empathy moderates these mediating effects, amplifying the positive influence of EOHRM on creativity when AI systems exhibit empathetic traits. Practical implications \u2013 Organizations that want to foster innovation in an AI environment should prioritize EOHRM practices that build trust and psychological safety. Managers should design AI systems that facilitate collaboration and incorporate empathy features to support positive human\u2013AI interactions. Encouraging creative job design can further enhance employees\u2019 intrinsic motivation to innovate. Originality/value \u2013 This study integrates the human resource management and AI literatures by conceptualizing EOHRM as both a strategic resource and a dynamic capability in fostering innovation.

    "abstract": "The adoption and integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools in Human Resource Management (HRM) have significantly enhanced decision-making and optimized core processes such as recruitment and employee performance evaluation. Despite these advancements, ethical challenges including algorithmic bias and data privacy remain critical concerns. Numerous studies emphasize the need to maintain a balance between automation and human oversight to ensure responsible and effective implementation. This study presents a systematic literature review (SLR) of research conducted between 2020 and 2025, focusing on the integration of AI within HRM. The literature highlights how AI contributes to process automation and operational efficiency, while also shedding light on the ethical risks posed by these technologies. In particular, the review evaluates AI\u2019s role in recruitment, performance management, and staff development, emphasizing the growing importance of ethical and innovative practices within organizations. Findings show that AI can significantly improve HR functions through automation and predictive analytics, particularly in enhancing employee engagement and streamlining administrative tasks. However, the deployment of such technologies must be approached with caution, as concerns regarding transparency, fairness, and the protection of employee data are increasingly prominent. Addressing these issues is essential for sustainable and trustworthy AI integration. This study underscores the need for organizations to adopt responsible strategies when implementing AI in HR. It offers practical insights to help leaders navigate both the opportunities and risks associated with emerging technologies. By proposing a balanced perspective, the study contributes to the ongoing discourse on ethical AI practices in HRM. Future research is encouraged to develop AI models capable of predicting employee behaviors while addressing ongoing ethical and privacy challenges. \u00a9 The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.",

The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) offers new opportunities to optimise workforce planning by enabling data-driven and analytical decision-making, as well as improving efficiency, accuracy and responsiveness. At the same time, AI adoption raises human-centric concerns such as employee well-being, job security and data ethics. This study aims to explore the dual role of AI in workforce planning by examining both its contributions to firm performance and its implications for employees. Design/methodology/approach \u2013 A systematic literature review (SLR) following PRISMA (identification, screening, eligibility, inclusion). Literature was collected from Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore and Google Scholar for English-language studies (2014\u20132024) on AI in workforce planning and its links to firm/organisational performance. After deduplication and screening, 50 articles were analysed in depth. Bibliometric mapping (VOSviewer) was combined with thematic coding. Findings \u2013 The results reveal five dominant themes: demand forecasting, workforce scheduling, skill gap analysis, recruitment and employee retention. Across these areas, AI enhances predictive accuracy, resource allocation and organisational flexibility. However, emerging concerns include algorithmic bias, job insecurity, labour relations and employee well-being. This indicates that AI adoption represents not only a technical improvement but also a socio-organisational transformation. Originality/value \u2013 Unlike earlier reviews that primarily emphasised efficiency, this study highlights the shift towards human-centric issues, including fairness, ethics and labour governance. It also contributes methodologically by combining bibliometric mapping with thematic coding to quantify theme prevalence and validate findings. \u00a9 2025 Febri Egasmara, Agus Rahayu, Lili Adi Wibowo, Rofi Rofaida, Alfira Sofia and Azizah Fauziyah",

AI is a critical gap in HRM, as it lacks a comprehensive analysis that aligns its capabilities with sustainability objectives. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to fill this gap by systematically reviewing the relationship between sustainable HRM and AI. Design/Methodology/Approach: This study employs a systematic literature review (SLR) methodology, and a thematic analysis approach was used to identify five key themes to analyze existing literature. These themes include AI-driven environmental sustainability in HRM, AI-enabled social sustainability and employee well-being, ethical implications and governance of AI in HRM, AI and sustainability pillars in HRM, and theories and methodologies used in AI-driven HRM. Based on selection criteria, 25 articles out of 312 were selected from top-tier journals of the Scopus database published during the years 2015\u20132025. Findings: The article\u2032s findings suggest that AI-enabled programs can be integrated with sustainable HRM to foster human-centric elements. This includes enhancing decision-making, promoting an ethical workplace environment, supporting employee well-being, and designing an environmentally friendly HRM framework. Such a framework should be aligned with the organization\u2032s overall sustainability goals. Implications: The findings have implications for scholars in the fields of AI and HRM, as well as the role of AI in supporting or hindering sustainable approaches in HRM. \u00a9 \u00a9 2025 Ali Junaid Khan et al.

    "abstract": "This research actualizes the development of a methodical image of the company within the framework of an HR strategy for digital marketing. The authors specified that this development should contain scientific and methodological recommendations for coordinated application in marketing. The authors employ scientific generalization, comparison, graphical interpretation, data analysis, and synthesis to conduct multilevel smart analytics of corporate marketing information. They also use AI as a technology for intelligent support in HR-marketing decision-making. Since it is impossible to fully monitor all human resources, HR marketers must make decisions based on incomplete information. While it comprehensively considers social and psychological effects, it tends to be technically irrational. This diminishes decision-making efficiency and often results in subjective, intuitive choices due to insufficient information. Thus, it is necessary to integrate social and ethical marketing opportunities into the organization\u2019s digital marketing HR strategy. The proposed methodological approach to shaping a company\u2019s image as a component of HR strategy in digital marketing offers several advantages. It enables the fullest exploration of digital technology\u2019s potential in enhancing the efficiency of developing and implementing marketing HR strategy. Additionally, it facilitates overcoming current limitations and drawbacks of AI in marketing, adapting it to the application in HR marketing of companies. \u00a9 2025 by World Scientific Publishing Co.

    "abstract": "This research aims to develop a marketing concept that emphasizes relationships with employees, prioritizing the social and ethical components. The authors use various methods, including scientific generalization, comparison, graphical interpretation, data analysis, and synthesis, to justify the need to investigate the integration capabilities of socio-ethical marketing into an organization\u2019s digital marketing HR strategy. Since it is impossible to monitor all aspects of human resources comprehensively, HR marketers often operate with incomplete information when making decisions. While they may consider social and psychological effects more thoroughly, this approach is technically irrational and diminishes decision-making efficiency. Consequently, it frequently results in subjective and intuitive decision-making that lacks sufficient information and analysis. This underscores the importance of integrating social and ethical marketing opportunities into the organization\u2019s digital marketing HR strategy. To ensure the high efficiency of the company\u2019s digital marketing HR strategy, it is necessary to integrate social and ethical marketing into it. The corresponding mechanism is proposed. Within the framework of this mechanism, the following tools are proposed: (1) socio-ethical criteria, (2) socio-ethical templates for strategic and operational HR marketing decisions used by artificial intelligence, (3) prioritization of strategic and operational HR marketing decisions by artificial intelligence in favor of socio-ethical marketing, (4) digital marketing HR monitoring of social ethics, (5) conducting socio-ethical HR marketing research through digital feedback collection, and (6) establishing socioethical boundaries of digital HR marketing. \u00a9 2025 by World Scientific Publishing Co.

    "abstract": "The digitalisation of the higher education (HE) sector has been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The increased usage of digital platforms, however, is a rather new phenomenon in HE systems. While some studies have shown the effects they have on the teaching and learning processes, there is still limited understanding of how digitalisation permeates university administrative systems and processes. While some authors point to the positive effects that platform services bring to higher education, others warn that HE\u2019s public stature, principles and values may be eroded by the EdTech industry and its market logics. Building on an extensive literature review, I characterise the platforms that specialise in services to support human resource management in HE, drawing on the examples from the HolonIQ database. I build on the notion of \u201cplatform capitalism\u201d (Srnicek, 2016) to understand the aims, services and business models of these platforms partnering with HE institutions (HEIs). The range of EdTech actors with digital solutions for performance management for higher education is very diverse. These actors promise increases in efficiency, user friendliness, and transparency of performance measurement and management processes. Data on platforms serving the higher education sector from HolonIQ, 2021 Global Learning Landscape show that 173 platforms use AI, machine learning, video and audio recognition, and bots to assist HEIs with performance management and human resource management, and among other tools, conducting performance appraisals. Overall, the findings suggest that EdTech platforms offer a wide range of services to HEIs, based on the B2B business model. The opacity of data gathering and value creation mechanisms of the studied platforms points to the \"platform capitalism\" features of the emerging ecosystem of HRM platforms in higher education. \u00a9 2026 The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s).",

In addition to documenting the company\u2019s approach, the study highlights the researchers\u2019 role in independently analyzing, validating and contextualizing the data from the case firm. By combining company access with interviews, user feedback and comparison to established research, the study provides a critical, evidence-informed account of how AI-enabled tools can address persistent hiring challenges, including inconsistent evaluation criteria, interviewer bias and inefficient decision-making processes. Design/methodology/approach \u2013 Adopting the impact case study method, this research draws on multiple data sources, including company documentation, demonstrations of AI-enabled features, interviews with practitioners and user feedback from pilot implementations. The analysis examines how Hireguide operationalizes research-backed selection methodologies through AI-powered tools and how the research team evaluated their effects against established selection science, thereby bridging the research\u2013practice divide in staffing. Findings \u2013 The study captured changes in how organizations structured and executed their hiring processes after adopting Hireguide. This case uses multiple evidence that reveal three key outcomes: (1) greater consistency in interviewer evaluations through standardized scorecards, (2) reductions in subjective bias by anchoring assessments in job-relevant competencies and (3) efficiency gains from AI-enabled automation of interviews and feedback synthesis. Originality/value \u2013 This case illustrates how AI-enhanced selection technologies can help organizations implement structured, competency-based hiring practices while also showing the importance of independent evaluation in assessing such technologies. We identify key factors contributing to Hireguide\u2019s effectiveness, including the integration of structured interview guides, AI-assisted evaluations and decision-support tools, and critically assess\u00a0their alignment with evidence research. The findings offer practical implications for HRM professionals and\u00a0organizations seeking to optimize talent acquisition through research-backed, technology-driven interventions, while also underscoring the need for evidence-based validation when implementing AI in HRM contexts. \u00a9 2025 Emerald Publishing Limited",

    "abstract": "Purpose \u2013 Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping recruitment by improving efficiency, scalability and perceived objectivity. Despite these advantages, AI-driven recruitment systems present ethical and governance challenges, including the risk of reinforcing historical biases and increasing workplace surveillance. This paper critically examines how algorithmic hiring affects recruitment outcomes, fairness and accountability. Design/methodology/approach \u2013 A comprehensive review of scholarly literature, industry practices, and regulatory developments is conducted to assess the implications of AI in recruitment. The analysis considers the relevance of general governance frameworks, such as the EU AI Act, and evaluates their applicability to human resource (HR) contexts. Insights from human resource management, organisational behaviour and technology ethics inform an integrated assessment. Findings \u2013 Existing AI regulations provide only indirect oversight of recruitment, failing to address the specific ethical risks of algorithmic hiring. The lack of mandatory mechanisms\u2014such as bias audits, explainability requirements and candidate appeals\u2014leaves AI-driven HR practices largely unregulated. This gap may exacerbate socio-economic inequities by reducing candidates to opaque algorithmic classifications. Targeted regulation and stronger corporate accountability are needed to align innovation with ethical standards. Practical implications \u2013 Employers should adopt transparent AI recruitment practices, including explainable systems, third-party bias audits, and clear candidate redressal pathways. Policymakers are encouraged to extend regulatory frameworks to explicitly cover HR-specific AI applications, ensuring fair access and safeguarding employment rights. Originality/value \u2013 This paper offers an interdisciplinary critique of AI hiring, bridging HRM, algorithmic ethics and regulatory policy.

We propose and evaluate an adaptive labor-market matching framework that treats the skill taxonomy as a living, reinforcement-learning-controlled graph, continuously updated from labor-market signals to improve matching quality and time-to-hire. Design/methodology/approach \u2013 The system integrates labor-economics mechanisms with modern AI. A multilingual transformer pipeline extracts skills from unstructured worker profiles and job ads; a graph neural network evolves the taxonomy; and a multi-agent reinforcement-learning layer optimizes matching policies while a feedback module aligns ranking signals with long-horizon outcomes (productivity and tenure). Evidence combines a longitudinal corpus spanning 2010\u20132025 across 18 countries (1.2\u00a0M worker profiles; 8.7\u00a0M job postings) with stress-test simulations against shocks and emerging skills. Findings \u2013 The framework improves Precision@1 by 9.4% over the best baseline, reduces time-to-hire by 37.2% versus static taxonomies (16.5% versus the best learning baseline), and attains 76.3% Precision@1 on post-2020 emerging skills.

    "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) become more widely used in hiring and human resource systems, concerns persist about their potential to reproduce or amplify bias. This study examined whether LLMs exhibit hiring discrimination based on age, gender, sexuality, and national origin. Using 24,000 simulated evaluations via ChatGPT, the study utilized a full factorial experimental design across three model versions, three temperature settings, and two job types. Applicant profiles were systematically varied using standardized r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, and hiring likelihood scores were elicited through structured prompts. The findings revealed significant but variable differences in hiring scores across all four sociodemographic dimensions. For example, women and gay or lesbian candidates received higher scores in some settings but not in others, while older and non-U.S.applicants almost consistently received lower scores. Drawing on psychological theories of bias and discrimination, these results suggest that LLMs may exhibit patterns consistent with implicit biases, and that their expression may vary across model configurations and job contexts. This study highlights the need for regular audits and context-specific evaluations of AI systems. As LLMs continue to be integrated into high-stakes decision-making domains, ensuring their equitable and ethical use remains an urgent research, development, and policy priority. \u00a9 2025 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

    "abstract": "Purpose \u2013 This study aims to examine the increased focus on neurodiversity in contemporary businesses. It shows how inclusive policies can capitalize on the special abilities of people with neurodiverse backgrounds, including their extraordinary problem-solving abilities, meticulous attention to detail and creative thinking. These policies benefit the individuals and contribute to a more diverse and innovative workplace. Design/methodology/approach \u2013 Data was collected through semistructured interviews with HR experts and neurodivergent employees. The qualitative data were manually analyzed and coded, and themes were identified. Findings \u2013 The results highlight the significant benefits of accepting neurodiversity in the workplace, enlightening the audience about its potential. For instance, artificial intelligence (AI) can be used to anonymize resumes, removing potential biases related to gender, ethnicity or age. In addition, AI can help in identifying the unique skills and strengths of neurodivergent employees, enhancing the fit between job responsibilities and their abilities. This study also emphasizes the wider effects of accepting neurodiversity on employee satisfaction, productivity and organizational innovation. This study promotes a deep learning framework that combines human-centered strategy with strategic methods to maximize the participation of neurodiverse workers and foster a more creative and dynamic corporate culture, convincing the audience of its benefits. Research limitations/implications \u2013 This study is limited by its qualitative nature and relatively small sample size, comprising 15 HR professionals and 20 neurodivergent employees, which restricts generalizability. The sensitive nature of neurodiversity also made participant recruitment challenging, with some individuals hesitant to disclose their condition. In addition, companies were reluctant to share internal AI practices due to confidentiality concerns. The research focused on a select set of organizations, primarily from specific regions, limiting cross-cultural applicability. Furthermore, the absence of AI developers in the sample means insights into technical tool design and implementation remain unexplored, suggesting a gap for future multidisciplinary research. Practical implications \u2013 This study provides actionable insights for HR professionals and organizational leaders aiming to improve neurodiverse hiring and support systems. It identifies specific AI tools such as Grammarly, Otter.ai and Pymetrics, that can be integrated into recruitment and workplace settings to enhance communication, reduce sensory overload and match roles to individual strengths. Organizations can use the deep learning framework proposed to design more inclusive policies and infrastructure. Training managers and customizing AI-driven accommodations can improve retention, engagement and performance among neurodiverse talent. This research supports firms in developing more equitable, adaptive and innovative environments aligned with diversity and inclusion goals. Social implications \u2013 This study promotes a societal shift in how neurodivergent individuals are perceived and supported in the workforce. By emphasizing ability over deficit and proposing inclusive AI integration, it helps reduce stigma and encourages broader acceptance of cognitive diversity. The findings advocate for universal accommodations that do not require self-disclosure, promoting dignity and equity. Improved employment outcomes for neurodiverse individuals contribute to economic inclusion, reduce unemployment rates and challenge ableist norms. The research also aligns with broader Diversity Equity and Inclusion (DEI) movements, inspiring organizations and policymakers to build socially responsible frameworks that reflect the value of every individual, regardless of neurological difference. Originality/value \u2013 This paper offers original value by exploring the underresearched intersection of AI and neurodiversity inclusion in the workplace. It contributes novel insights through qualitative analysis of HR professionals and neurodivergent employees, highlighting the role of AI in reducing hiring bias, customizing work environments and enhancing employee well-being. By proposing a deep learning framework and cataloging AI tools matched to neurodiverse conditions, this study bridges theory and practice. It uniquely positions AI as both a technological and ethical enabler for inclusive employment, making it highly relevant for scholars, practitioners and policymakers aiming to foster equitable, future-ready workplaces. \u00a9 2025 Emerald Publishing Limited",

    "abstract": "Talent management is the most crucial areas that define the success of an organization, as it impacts the efficiency of the workforce and competitiveness. Traditional recruitment and workforce planning systems are often proven to be subjective, time-consuming, and biased in favor of human opinion. Businesses need to adopt AI-driven solutions that enhance talent acquisition, management, and retention in changing workforce dynamics. Most organizations still use older methods of recruitment despite the improvement in technology, and this has been a hindrance to efficiency and effectiveness. Until now, very few studies have given detailed insights about the long-term effects of AI-driven tools on workforce performance and organization growth. This study fills this gap by focusing on applications in AI-driven talent management based on an assessment of its features, pricing for enhancing recruitment, workforce planning, and employee engagement. The chapter uses a both method approach with qualitative and quantitative analysis based on case studies, industry reports, and literature reviews, all of which focus on how AI-driven tools impact efficiency, fairness, and decision-making in HR functions. The findings suggest that AI highly improves recruitment through the automation process, enhances hiring decisions, and mitigates bias. Predictive analytics optimize the workforce planning process, while AI chatbots help in employee engagement and communication. This is challenged by algorithmic bias, ethical concerns, and resistance to adoption by many. By responsibly implementation of AI in the workforce, this can only happen through aligning organizations to embrace a more ethical utilization of AI, and improving algorithms to eliminate bias, in addition to the interdependency of the HR professional to the policymaker in achieving more open and fair structures in AI which guarantee effective, responsible integration into the management of the workforce. \u00a9 2026 selection and editorial matter, Manisha Singh and Renu Jangra.",

It examines the role of HCI in designing user-centric AI tools and introduces Hybrid Cognitive Authority (the co-construction of knowledge between human and AI agents) and Algorithmic Subjectivity (AI-generated communication simulating intent without cognition) to evaluate their effects on decision-making, knowledge flows and ethical governance in commercial settings. Design/methodology/approach \u2013 A mixed-methods approach integrates interdisciplinary genealogical analysis, qualitative case studies and critical discourse analysis. The study traces the evolution of commercial communication from mid-20th-century pragmatics to AI-mediated paradigms, synthesizing insights from cognitive science, information systems and digital epistemology. Five case studies of AI and HCI applications in business (e.g. customer service, recruitment) and discourse analysis of AI-generated artifacts provide empirical evidence for assessing knowledge management outcomes. Findings \u2013 Generative AI, supported by HCI, enhances knowledge management by improving efficiency and scalability, but raises challenges related to transparency, algorithmic bias and accountability. Empirical cases demonstrate how hybrid human-AI systems optimize knowledge processes while highlighting ethical risks, such as biased outputs. The proposed framework of Hybrid Cognitive Authority and Algorithmic Subjectivity necessitates governance models that balance AI automation with human oversight to maintain trust and interpretive agency. Originality/value \u2013 Unlike prior studies that view AI as a passive tool, this research positions AI as an active knowledge co-constructor, advancing knowledge management scholarship through the novel concepts of Hybrid Cognitive Authority and Algorithmic Subjectivity. It bridges theory and practice by offering actionable strategies for businesses to leverage AI and HCI responsibly, contributing to economic efficiency, ethical governance and societal trust in AI-driven communication. \u00a9 2025 Emerald Publishing Limited",

Design/methodology/approach \u2013 A systematic review of the Web of Science database analyzed 23 peer-reviewed articles (2000\u20132025) using the TCCM (Theory\u2013Context\u2013Characteristics\u2013Methodology) framework to synthesize trends and gaps. Findings \u2013 AI enhances OL through socio-technical integration, sensemaking, and human-machine coordination, with tools like generative AI and machine learning boosting informal learning and innovation. However, risks include overreliance, ethical concerns, and limited focus on diverse contexts. Qualitative and conceptual methods dominate, with few longitudinal studies. Research limitations/implications \u2013 The broad temporal scope may dilute context-specific findings. Future research should prioritize empirical studies in underrepresented settings, focusing on emotional and ethical dimensions. Practical implications \u2013 Organizations can leverage AI for real-time feedback and informal learning but must ensure ethical alignment, human judgment, and cultural support to enhance agility and inclusivity. Originality/value \u2013 This pioneering review applies the TCCM framework to a comprehensive AI-OL literature set, offering novel insights into human-AI collaboration and ethical integration. \u00a9 2025 Emerald Publishing Limited",

Purpose-led organisations rely on aligning employee roles and contributions with the overarching purpose, making effective people management essential to achieving shared goals. The chapter examines each stage of the employee life cycle, including recruitment and onboarding, learning and development, performance management and rewards, involvement, and exit, through the lens of sustainable and digital Human Resource Management (HRM) practices. Both academic research and case studies are provided to illustrate how sustainable and digital HRM, along with people analytics, have been adopted to support and achieve the purpose-driven objectives. Finally, five key challenges unique to purpose-led organisations are identified and discussed, including (1) balancing purpose with profitability; (2) integrating consistency with personalisation in people management; (3) leveraging technologies and analytics with a human touch; (4) ensuring ethical and legal use of technologies, AI, and analytics in supporting purpose-led people management; and (5) fostering cross-functional leadership collaboration in purpose-led organisations. Practical recommendations offer purpose professionals strategies to navigate these challenges, enhancing purpose alignment across the workforce. \u00a9 2026 selection and editorial matter, Katie Bailey and Katie Manning; individual chapters, the contributors.

It focuses on recruitment processes, ethical considerations, and employee participation. Methodology: A systematic literature review was conducted in Scopus covering the period 2019\u20132024, following PRISMA guidelines. The initial search yielded 1486 records. After de-duplication and screening using Rayyan, 66 studies (\u2248 4.4%) met the inclusion criteria, which targeted peer-reviewed works addressing AI-supported HR decision-making. A combined content and bibliometric analysis was performed in R (Bibliometrix) to identify thematic patterns and conceptual structures. Results: Analysis revealed four thematic clusters: 1) Implementation and employee participation emphasizing human-in-the-loop approaches and effective change management; 2) ethical challenges including algorithmic bias, transparency gaps, and data privacy risks; 3) data-driven decision-making delivering higher accuracy, fewer errors, and personalized recruitment and performance assessment; 4) operational efficiency enabling faster workflows and reduced administrative workloads. AI tools consistently improved selection quality, while OS practices promoted transparency and knowledge sharing. Implications: The successful adoption of AI in HRM requires employee engagement, strong ethical safeguards, and transparent data governance. Future research should address the long-term cultural, organizational, and well-being impacts of AI integration, as well as its sustainability. \u00a9 \u00a9 2025 by author(s).

    "abstract": "In recent years, research has shifted its attention toward artificial intelligence (AI) and its impact on the workplace. However, there is insufficient systematic review that summarizes the role of AI in facilitating a smooth transition within organizations as they navigate change, address challenges in maintaining a positive workplace culture, and define the role of leadership in a new environment where humans and AI coexist. Further research is needed to examine the ethical concerns, potential biases, and risks of relying more on technology, which may impact on employee engagement and productivity of organizations. This study aims to systematically review recent articles to explore the role of AI in assisting successful organizational change, managing a resilient work culture, and supporting effective leadership. The databases EBSCO-ERIC, ProQuest, and JSTOR were used to search eligible articles published with the query terms human resources, AI and organizational change, AI and organizational culture, leadership, and ethical AI practices. Articles from online news sources were also reviewed. A total of 79 articles were included in this study. The authors found that artificial intelligence and humans can co-manage the organizations by resolving a set of identified issues. Implementation of AI creates organizational change, which can be well-managed by effective leadership and dynamic organizational culture. Organizational change in turn has an impact on the organizational culture. There should be a more balanced human-AI centric approach while personalizing AI tools to align with organizational goals and values. Specific organizational cases are discussed to display the opportunities and pitfalls of applying AI. Recommendations are provided to establish ethical guidelines promoting inclusivity, fostering a culture of continuous learning for sustainable organizational growth while embracing change. \u00a9 2025 The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",

It examines how AI can enhance efficiency, decision-making, and organizational performance by analyzing traditional HR functions through a theoretical lens. Using a literature review and theoretical analysis, the study delves into AI applications in recruitment, employee engagement, performance management, and training. Ethical concerns such as bias, fairness, and data privacy are also addressed, emphasizing the need for balanced integration. The proposed framework highlights key components and relationships in AI-enhanced HRM, providing a structured understanding of the subject. By synthesizing existing research, the study identifies theoretical constructs and challenges linked to AI in HRM. It serves as a guide for future empirical research and practical applications, emphasizing that AI should complement human decision-making rather than replace it. The article contributes to both academic discourse and practical insights for HR professionals, fostering evidence-based adoption of AI technologies while addressing ethical and organizational concerns. \u00a9 The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.",

Design/methodology/approach \u2013 Drawing on the resource-based view and dynamic managerial capabilities perspectives, we conceptualise managerial capabilities as the applied manifestation of the microfoundations of dynamic managerial capabilities, in the context of artificial intelligence implementation. Data from 245 HR professionals involved in artificial intelligence driven recruitment were analysed using structural equation modelling. Findings \u2013 HR competency and open innovation, operating through the microfoundations of dynamic managerial capabilities and manifested in managerial capabilities, significantly drive artificial intelligence adoption. Top management support strengthens these relationships by ensuring strategic alignment and resource mobilisation. Artificial intelligence adoption enhances competitive advantage by integrating human expertise with artificial intelligence\u2013enabled capabilities. Research limitations/implications \u2013 The study does not capture longitudinal dynamics and their generalisability across different cultural and industrial contexts. Practical implications \u2013 Organisations should build internal capabilities, foster external innovation partnerships and secure leadership commitment to ensure responsible and strategically aligned artificial intelligence adoption. Social implications \u2013 The adoption of AI in recruitment processes underscores the pivotal role of human-machine collaboration, enhancing HR practices and promoting a competitive edge in the labour market. This shift necessitates a re-evaluation of workforce dynamics and the ethical considerations surrounding AI integration in human resource management. Originality/value \u2013 This study offers a novel perspective on how intangible resources and managerial capabilities interact to drive artificial intelligence adoption and reshape competitive advantage in recruitment contexts. \u00a9 2025 Emerald Publishing Limited",

    "abstract": "This chapter\u2019s content is part of the discussion on the humanisation of management and building human-centric organisations. This chapter presents arguments proving that AI can contribute to humanising and dehumanising human resource management (HRM). The considerations prove that a critical look at implementing AI-driven solutions is needed to counteract dehumanisation, prevent the effect of secondary Taylorism, and shape symbiotic human-robot relationships. This chapter presents the results of a narrative literature review and an empirical study conducted using the writing expression technique according to the instructions of 115 master\u2019s students with work experience. The respondents saw both the benefits and threats of using new technologies in HRM. Research shows that employee perception of new technologies varies. Understanding employees\u2019 needs and concerns is the basis for making changes in HRM to ensure these changes are successful. Working with employees to build trust is important, ensuring the positive impact of AI-powered workforce management systems. It is necessary to identify psychosocial risks systematically. To facilitate the process of integrating employees with AI, it is worth involving them in the design, development, and decision-making about the use of technology. They confirm that perceptions of AI in HRM can influence the acceleration or deceleration of change associated with AI implementation. This chapter delivers a necessity to take a critical look at technology development, provide upskilling and reskilling opportunities to develop competencies that give humans an advantage over robots, and take care for employee participation in implementing new technologies. This chapter may benefit HRM researchers, particularly those interested in using AI in HRM, managers, consultants, and students. \u00a9 2026 selection and editorial matter, Micha\u0142 Szostak; individual chapters, the contributors.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into organisational leadership represents a fundamental transformation in management practices, presenting opportunities and challenges for contemporary leaders. This chapter examines how AI-driven tools and systems reshape leadership styles and competencies, particularly concerning employee engagement, development, and communication. It also examines their intersection with the aesthetic dimensions of humanistic management, which requires maintaining emotional resonance and genuine human interactions alongside AI adoption. Through a systematic literature review, this study investigates two primary research questions: Which leadership styles are most susceptible to the impact of AI integration and what new competencies and roles are emerging for leaders in AI-driven contexts? The analysis reveals that transformational, servant, and adaptive leadership styles demonstrate the most significant evolution through AI integration, with transformational leadership showing particularly enhanced capabilities in driving innovation and organisational change through AI-powered analytics and automation. Moreover, the findings highlight how aesthetic and ethical considerations intersect with technologically augmented decision-making, including the need to preserve emotional resonance, authentic human interactions, and empathy. The emergence of hybrid leadership models enables these styles to leverage AI while maintaining essential human elements of leadership. This study identifies three critical areas of emerging competencies: technical literacy, strategic integration, and ethical leadership, all enriched by an aesthetic sensitivity towards organisational culture and stakeholder experience. Leaders and managers seeking to understand the impact of AI on their roles, HR professionals interested in AI-driven talent management and employee development, and academics and researchers studying the evolving landscape of leadership in the age of AI can benefit from reading this chapter. \u00a9 2026 selection and editorial matter, Micha\u0142 Szostak; individual chapters, the contributors.",

We present a minimal, transparent audit protocol for large language models (LLMs) in a hiring context and apply it to OpenAI's ChatGPT 4.5 (Orion) and Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro. Using 10 synthetic CVs (5 per model), we measure (i) the realism of generated career trajectories via the correlation between Age and Years of Experience (YoE), and (ii) fairness of a Seniority threshold (YoE\u2265 12) across Gender and Age group. We disclose the exact prompts used to generate the CVs and the rules for parsing textual YoE values (e.g., '7+') into numeric data to ensure reproducibility. Formal correlation statistics show that ChatGPT produces a strong and significant Age-YoE association (Pearson r=.91, p=.03; Spearman p=.90, p =.04), whereas Gemini shows a moderate, non-significant relationship (r=.58, p=.30; p=.50, p=.39). No CV reached the Seniority threshold, precluding fairness tests and illustrating how threshold design can mask disparities. Our results demonstrate how lightweight audits can surface model-behaviour differences and audit-design vulnerabilities before deployment, offering HR practitioners a practical on-ramp to ethical AI oversight under high-risk regulatory regimes such as the EU AI Act. \u00a9 2025 IEEE.",

The experimental data demonstrates that the new hiring process using AI achieved a hiring accuracy rise of 21.4% together with a time reduction of 39% and a bias reduction of 23.7% beyond standard hiring systems. The model delivered a 92.3% F1-score exceeding the F1-scores achieved by currently used AI solutions for hiring. The proposed recruitment system boosts processing efficiency and higher fairness and transparency while providing excellent suitability for large government hiring programs. In the Future, it will concentrate on implementing the model in real-time applications together with developing its capabilities to adapt to multiple positions across different job categories. \u00a9 2025 IEEE.",

    "abstract": "In the current world where artificial intelligence (AI) is employed in evaluating employees' performance, there has been a raised concern on the issues of bias and fairness. This research paper aims at exploring the systematic bias of AI-based performance assessment models based on age, education level, and departmental status. The present work is based on the large-scale dataset of employee performance and reveals measurement, representation, aggregation, and historical bias in AI-based assessments. In its current state, AI discriminates employee competencies based on the set categories and replicates the traditional organizational hierarchy. This study underlines the importance of the development of better and more sophisticated methods for AI assessment that take into consideration factors such as fairness, interpretability of the algorithm and context awareness. The recommendations presented will be useful to organisations and policymakers who wish to reduce bias arising from the use of artificial intelligence in performance management systems. \u00a9 2025 IEEE.",

    "abstract": "This study examines the factors that influence integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into human resources management (HRM) in Jordanian banks, a sector that has not yet extensively adopted AI. This study uses a mixed-method technique that includes both qualitative and quantitative approaches, the research consists of a sample of 130 HR directors and other stakeholders from seven commercial banks in Jordan. The main data-gathering instruments were surveys and interviews programmed to meet the research objectives and to confirm the research hypotheses. The major findings indicate some substantial barriers and challenges that prevent AI's integration into the HRM in Jordanian banks. Such barriers include a lack of knowledge, poor skillful personnel, employee resistance to change, and privacy and security concerns about data. Despite many challenges such as high costs of AI implementation, and difficulties in AI implementation, and regulatory and compliance issues the study demonstrates that AI can positively affect HRM by enhancing talent acquisition, automating routine tasks, and other HR functions. According to the experimental validation of our proposition, AI can be used in HRM to improve productivity and reduce time wastage on administrative tasks with enough provision of financial and material resources. It concludes by giving practical advice on how the given barriers and challenges may be overcome and how AI could be optimally employed to boost HRM services in Jordan's banking sector. If these barriers and challenges are addressed and the potential benefits of its implementation are showcased, then banks can enhance their HRM practices which will eventually lead to improved organizational performance as well as competitiveness. \u00a9 2025 IEEE.",

The paper is a discussion of deep learning as it is incorporated in WFM systems, a critical review of the available literature, approaches, and current events will be discussed using both secondary data analysis and empirical research designs. Prominent deep learning architectures, such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and Transformer-based models, are considered in the context of their use in scheduling, attrition forecasting, and workforce planning. The results indicate that, in comparison with customary statistical methods, DL models are far superior in prediction accuracy, flexibility, and adaptability.

In this project, I develop such a holistic personality analysis system using state of the art machine learning models to infer and predict personality traits from behavioral, psychological and social data. The system uses trickling along of both traditional and deep learning algorithms to craft a personality output based on personality frameworks like the Five Factor Model and Carl Jung's cognitive functions for a holistic personality profile. Moreover, hybrid models involving the hybridization of collaborative and content filtering techniques are used to match mentor and mentee and aimed to improve such selection process through personality compatibility. To show the adaptability of the model across domains, the research involves examining various data sources including handwriting analysis, social media behavior as well as educational performance. Further in this paper, personalized guidance and decision making in education, workplace dynamics and personal development are further brought forward from a broader view. The suggested approach improves both the accuracy of personality predictions and offers useful information for tailored guidance in a variety of professional and educational settings. Future work will be to combine generative models for personalized learning, as well as the ethical implications of personality detection. \u00a9 2025 IEEE.",

However, there is limited understanding of how the reliability of these functions, as experienced by workers, impacts their trust and engagement. Grounded in the transactional model of stress and coping, this study examines the influence of experienced algorithmic reliability on gig workers' trust in their platforms and their subsequent work engagement. We further explore how occupational stigma consciousness moderates this mediated relationship. Through a time-lagged survey of 332 gig workers, our findings indicate that reliable algorithmic management experiences significantly enhance trust and subsequently work engagement. Moreover, this relationship is complicated by occupational stigma consciousness, which can diminish the positive effects of algorithmic reliability on trust and engagement. This study deepens our understanding of technology-mediated work environments, emphasizing the critical role of workers' experiences with AI-driven HRM functions in enhancing engagement and well-being. \u00a9 2025 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",

While several reviews have focussed on AI in human resource management in general, none of these have examined the RSP in detail or employed an AI taxonomy for clustering. Consequently, we applied an AI taxonomy identified in the literature with the aim to identify the stages of the RSP in the focus of research and the algorithms mostly used. We conducted a systematic literature review underpinned by a concept matrix, complemented by a computational literature review (CLR), that employed natural language processing (NLP). The initial 4,579 studies were sourced from three databases and narrowed down to a total of 502. Our major findings indicate that the majority of studies were categorised under the stages \u201cassessment & selection\u201d and \u201cprocessing incoming applications\u201d in the RSP. The predominant algorithms in use pertain to the field of NLP and machine learning. The CLR emphasised the significance of ethics in AI research. While our study has expanded the general AI taxonomy by incorporating an ethical perspective and is one of the studies with the most articles used to reflect this topic, it is solely focussing on describing the past. Nevertheless, this article helps to align research on exploring and testing alternative approaches with those most frequently used. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2025.

    "abstract": "The conventional process of career development and placement frequently encounters issues such as a lack of clarity, inefficiency, and restricted access to resources for students. To combat these problems, the research put forward a Decentralized Career Development Platform that utilizes blockchain technology. This platform seeks to establish a secure, transparent, and effective ecosystem for student placements through features like blockchain-based identity verification, permanent records of accomplishments, and decentralized document storage via IPFS. The core objective of this research is to showcase how Ethereum vaults can be used as a seamless authentication mechanism and how IPFS ensures secure, tamper proof file storage, proving its application in privacy focused systems. This application stands as a proof of concept to highlight that such an architecture can be adapted to any everyday secure digital service, not just limited to placements. Our platform is designed with an easy- to-use interface for students, allowing them to apply for jobs, access resources for placement preparation, and earn token rewards for engaging in skill-enhancing activities. Placement coordinators will find an improved system for managing company data and automating processes, while companies receive access to verifiable and tamper-resistant student profiles, confirming their legitimacy. Additionally, the platform incorporates AI-powered mentorship matching and customized resources for placement preparation, enabling students to adequately prepare for career opportunities. By integrating Ethereum-based smart contracts, the research facilitates trustless interactions and bolster security for all participants. This paper explores the technical framework, main features, and advantages of our platform, emphasizing how the combination of blockchain and AI can transform career development for today's students. \u00a9 2025 IEEE.",

While studies show that people prefer human over AI interactions, it is unclear whether this preference holds regardless of the comparative quality of these interactions, where quality is understood in terms of varying levels of warmth and competence. We addressed this using an experimental vignettes study supplemented by open-ended questions. Participants (N = 1067) were subject to a 2 (human or AI interviewer) X 2 (high or low competence) X 2 (high or low warmth) factorial design and asked to rate and explain their perceptions of the interaction. We found that human interactions led to better outcomes on our proxies for interaction quality, compared to AI interactions, and that humans were seen as both warmer and more competent. However, we also found that higher quality AI interactions sometimes led to better interaction quality measures compared to lower quality human interactions. Moreover, we found that while participants were sensitive to variations in both warmth and competence, warmth was the more important factor. These findings have important implications for the ethical deployment of AI in workplaces, given their impact on how satisfied and respected people feel during their interactions with AI. \u00a9 2025 The Author(s).

    "abstract": "AI-driven recruitment systems offer potential benefits in improving hiring efficiency and reach. However, without explicit attention to inclusivity, these systems risk perpetuating historical biases and reinforcing systemic inequalities. While ethical guidelines for inclusive AI exist, organisations face challenges in operationalising them, particularly in complex, real-world settings like online employment platforms. This paper investigates how inclusive design principles, grounded in diversity and inclusion guidelines, can be translated into requirements for AI-driven recruitment systems. We partnered with SEEK, a leading employment marketplace in the Asia-Pacific region, to conduct a co-design workshop focused on identifying and contextualising inclusivity requirements from AI-based hiring use cases. Using requirements engineering techniques of user stories, personas, and stakeholder reflection, we explored two use cases and conducted follow-up interviews six months later to evaluate the impact and sustainability of these efforts. Our findings reveal challenges in aligning inclusivity with business priorities, navigating trade-offs, and addressing data limitations. We present industry-informed lessons on how requirements engineering can support the operationalisation of inclusive AI principles, offering guidance for practitioners aiming to embed diversity and inclusion principles in AI systems. This work contributes to integrating ethical design into AI development lifecycles through stakeholder-driven requirements processes. \u00a9 2025 IEEE.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence algorithms are increasingly used today in the establishment of employment relationship. This is because artificial intelligence tools make it possible to determine to whom recruitment advertisement is to be shown, to scan CVs, to reach passive candidates by pulling personal data from social media or different data points, to conduct online/video interviews with the candidates, and to subject the cognitive or emotional characteristics of candidates to algorithmic evaluations. While using these technologies, also known as \u2018algorithmic recruitment\u2019, accelerates human resource processes, saves time, reduces costs, and identifies the most suitable candidate(s), it also poses serious risks to prospective employees. This is because artificial intelligence technologies may be algorithmically biased toward candidates based on gender, race, personality traits, etc. In this context, discrimination against women is one of the most common types of algorithmic discrimination. The aim of this study is the examination of this problem from the perspective of human rights and labor law. Therefore, algorithmic discrimination against women in the context of recruitment, its causes, forms of occurrence, legal effects, and measures that can be taken will be discussed in light of comparative law and within the framework of current developments. \u00a9 2026 selection and editorial matter, Muharrem K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 and Sezer Bozku\u015f Kahyao\u011flu; individual chapters, the contributors.",

Utilizing a mixed-methods approach, the analysis is based on a structured survey and in-depth interviews conducted with 30 HR specialists from Armenian ICT companies in Yerevan between January and February 2025. The results of the expert survey were analyzed using descriptive statistics, frequency analysis, and cross-tabulation tests in SPSS software. The findings revealed significant opportunities for using AI in human resources management within the ICT sector. These opportunities include improving management processes for employees and saving time and financial resources through the effective use of artificial intelligence in HRM. However, there are also evident challenges, such as the comparatively slow rate of AI integration in HRM (only 43.4% use AI tools in HRM), and risks associated with human\u2013AI imbalance (27.8%), information protection (27.8%), job displacement (18.5%), AI bias (16.7%), and resistance to change (9.3%). Nevertheless, the findings revealed no correlation between company size and the level of AI implementation in HRM (Pearson Chi-Square = 0.143, p = 0.931), which does not support the hypothesis of a \u2018digital divide\u2019 within the sector whereby larger companies are more likely to implement AI than small and medium-sized enterprises. The study highlights the importance of balancing AI technology with the human factor, developing ethical standards, investing in AI literacy, and implementing targeted training programs. \u00a9 The author(s) 2025.

    "abstract": "The world is transforming at a rapid pace. With fast-changing technologies, the landscape of business has evolved tremendously, especially in the tech industry. In this dynamic environment, studying the implications of artificial intelligence in job satisfaction and workplace diversity has become much more crucial. Using a structured questionnaire collected from 278 randomly selected IT employees working in the Cyberpark of Kerala, this study examines the perceptions of IT employees towards AI, job satisfaction, and diversity initiatives in their workplace. Using SPSS and JASP tools such as percentage, ANOVA, descriptive statistics, t-test, correlation, regression, factor analysis, and path analysis the results revealed that even though the employees had high concerns about the ethical implications of AI, they strongly believed in the significant role played by the AI in boosting morale and productivity. The study found that there is a significant positive correlation between diversity initiatives and satisfaction levels. As per the findings, the employees were highly contented with the physical environment and least satisfied with the grievance redressal mechanisms and the meaninglessness of the job they were asked to perform. If the management addresses these challenges, the organization will be able to reap the benefits of AI and diversity initiatives that will result in a satisfied and productive workforce. \u00a9 The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.",

The authors argue that Congress\u2019s failure to recognize freedom from age discrimination as a fundamental right and courts\u2019 weakening of federal law have relegated age discrimination victims to \u201csecond-class status.\u201d The chapter examines significant trends, including forced arbitration, the devastating impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, the increase in age discrimination against older women, and artificial intelligence and hiring discrimination. To dismantle ageism in US workplaces, the authors propose that Congress add age to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act and ban forced arbitration that strips workers of the right to go to court and bring class actions. This would ensure that victims of age discrimination have the same rights and remedies as other workers. Finally, employers must commit to age-inclusive practices to truly value the contributions of all workers at all ages. \u00a9 The Editors and Contributors Severally 2025.",

This paper reviews the application of Explainable AI technologies throughout the entire talent recruitment process, aiming to analyze the role of XAI in enhancing decision-making transparency and traceability. The study finds that XAI, through interpretable algorithms such as LIME, SHAP, knowledge graphs, and causal reasoning, has significantly improved semantic understanding in resume parsing, precision in person-job recommendations, and analytical capabilities in interview evaluations. However, potential biases in generative large models, insufficient cross-scenario interpretability, and computational efficiency issues remain major bottlenecks. Future research should focus on dynamic fairness constraints and the integration of lightweight interpretability tools to promote the coordinated development of XAI in terms of ethical compliance, user trust, and practicality. \u00a9 2025 The Author(s).

Already, AI has become a critical element in customer decision-making, as witnessed via customer-facing platforms like Netflix and Amazon. Companies are rapidly adopting AI to enhance talent management practices, including recruitment, selection, and performance reviews. As the use of AI becomes more widespread, managers will need to be prepared to address significant concerns voiced by job applicants and employees whose livelihoods could be impacted. Anecdotal evidence suggests that employees are concerned about issues of transparency, fairness, and the potential for bias in AI algorithms, and as a result, they may perceive its use as unfair. Decades of research have shown that employees who experience or witness unfair treatment tend to exhibit undesirable attitudinal and behavioral characteristics. To assist managers in deploying AI in a manner that employees will embrace rather than resist, organizational justice theory is utilized to develop recommendations for anticipating, understanding, and addressing employee reactions to talent management decisions informed by AI. \u00a9 2025 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University",

The research community as well as chief human resources officers (CHROs) have been taking strong initiatives to examine the use of AI in human resource management (HRM) function, including harmonious human\u2013machine collaboration. The AI-HRM area is under-researched, and this study addresses an important research gap regarding the benefits and challenges of AI applications in HRM. Design/methodology/approach \u2013 The study adopts a qualitative research methodology (abductive case research) and collects data from multiple sources in three Indian companies. These organizations span diverse sectors and were at different stages of AI adoption in HRM at the time of the study. The multi-data-sources strategy helps triangulation and establishes credibility of the research. Findings \u2013 The findings provide a clear view about the benefits of AI applications in HRM, higher productivity, recruitment efficiency, adaptive learning and high-quality HR decisions. The study also underpins key challenges, including a lack of human touch, employees\u2019 loss of control over jobs and the fear of losing jobs to AI. Originality/value \u2013 The research provides a theoretical contribution to the growing AI-HRM literature in the context of the theory of cost economics in the context of recruitment efficiency as well as leveraging adaptive learning from the context of the multi-level organizational learning framework to improve the performance of the HR function. The research also provides significant managerial insights for CHROs recommending that they embrace humanized AI in the HRM function and institutionalize AI ethics. \u00a9 2025 Emerald Publishing Limited",

    "abstract": "Purpose \u2013 As artificial intelligence (AI) reshapes workplace systems, traditional leadership models struggle to address the complexities of human-AI collaboration. This study explores the evolving competencies, behaviors, and identity transformations necessary for effective leadership in AI-augmented environments, particularly within the Indian context. Design/methodology/approach \u2013 Employing a grounded theory methodology, 60 in-depth interviews were conducted with leaders across diverse industries in India. Data were analyzed inductively to build a contextually rich, systemic framework of leadership in the AI era. Findings \u2013 The study identifies a three-pillar model of leadership transformation in AI-augmented workplaces: anticipatory-ethical leadership, socio-technical reengineering, and ontological shifts in leader identity. Leaders proactively address AI's ethical challenges, redesign organizational practices to balance technology and human values, and shift from control-based to distributed, dialogic leadership styles to foster innovation and collective adaptation. Practical implications \u2013 Recommendations are offered for HR practitioners and organizational leaders to navigate AI transitions through foresight, empathy, and systemic awareness. Emphasis is placed on fostering distributed leadership, ethical AI integration, and innovation ecosystems that elevate human potential alongside technological advances. Social implications \u2013 Beyond organizational practices, the AI-era leadership framework has broad implications for public policy and inter-organizational governance, especially in emerging economies. Leadership development must extend beyond firms into national education systems, ethical AI policies, and multi-stakeholder governance. Categories such as ethical tech sense making and equity tracing can guide certification programs and accountability standards, while inclusive AI socialization and role reengineering inform leadership training in universities and public service academies. At a cross-sector level, shared governance alliances can set norms for refusal criteria, recertification, and equity protections. Ultimately, AI leadership demands systemic, multi-level capacity building for inclusive, sustainable development. Originality/value \u2013 The study advances leadership theory by integrating cultural context, emotional labor, and collective resilience into discussions of AI-era leadership. It highlights the systemic, relational, and ethical dimensions that are critical but often overlooked in AI transition narratives. \u00a9 2025 Emerald Publishing Limited",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) tools have increasingly been shaping employment decisions, from resume screening to employment tests and automated video interviews. Concerns about the \"black box\" nature of these tools have grown as many of these algorithmic models offer little insight into how or why hiring decisions occur. This lack of transparency undermines fairness, accountability, and regulatory compliance, especially in contexts where bias may persist or worsen. Explainable AI (XAI) is emerging as a critical strategy to address these concerns by providing interpretable outputs that reveal the model's logic and decision-making factors. This study presents a systematic review of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques utilized in hiring and employment-related AI systems. It identifies prominent methods, such as Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME), decision trees, and counterfactuals, and evaluates their performance in terms of interpretability, fidelity, and fairness. Additionally, it examines their impact on candidate trust and organizational transparency. The findings suggest while XAI can improve understanding and reduce biases, technical complexity and human interpretability issues often limit its effectiveness. The paper concludes by recommending a human-centred approach to XAI design and the development of stronger regulatory frameworks for fair and equitable hiring practices. \u00a9 2025 International Association for Computer Information Systems.

    "abstract": "The proliferation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Human Resource Management (HRM) offers significant efficiencies but concurrently introduces critical ethical challenges regarding transparency, fairness, and accountability, thereby impacting sustainable workforce management. The novelty of this study lies in its exploration of strategies for effectively managing these ethical dimensions in AI-driven HRM, with a focus on identifying practical solutions to mitigate algorithmic bias and enhance transparency. The research focuses on identifying ethical issues, such as algorithmic bias and lack of transparency in AI-assisted recruitment, performance evaluation, and overall employee management. Adopting a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) methodology, this paper analyzes recent publications (2019-2024) from Scopus to synthesize existing knowledge on AI ethics in HRM. Key findings reveal a significant lack of standardized best practices and audit trails, with opaque AI-driven decisions often undermining trust and fairness. If not properly designed, AI algorithms can perpetuate biases embedded in historical data, leading to discriminatory outcomes, as evidenced by cases at companies like Amazon and HireVue. The study concludes that organizations must proactively implement robust governance frameworks, including ethics training, the development of transparent and fair-by-design algorithms, regular audits, and mechanisms for human oversight. Integrating frameworks such as Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (FAT) and Ethical AI by Design is crucial for ensuring that AI applications in HRM are ethically sound, legally compliant, and contribute to sustainable and equitable workforce management. \u00a9 2025 IEEE.",

    "abstract": "Automated resume screening tools have become popular because they save time and make the hiring process more efficient. However, these tools have sparked concerns around fairness and transparency, as there is a risk that they could reinforce existing biases. To address this issue, we are proposing a hybrid framework that combines straightforward content evaluation with sentiment analysis and explicit fairness rules. Our approach uniquely integrates a well-known sentiment analysis tool called VADER, which helps gauge the positivity of language used in resumes, alongside a simple measure of information each resume provides. Additionally, the framework incorporates an expert system that implements specific fairness rules to identify and adjust for potential biases. In the experiment with a real set of resumes, the framework confirmed its ability to effectively rank candidates based on their qualifications while also identifying and reducing bias in the evaluation process. The results revealed that most resumes received high fairness scores, showing minimal bias issues. Overall, our hybrid framework demonstrates a practical way to make automated resume evaluations more transparent, fair, and balanced by combining NLP tools with human-inspired fairness rules. \u00a9 2025 IEEE.",

Drawing on Organizational Justice Theory, we propose a multi-stage, multi-disciplinary framework to systematically categorize and analyze fairness perceptions throughout the selection process, spanning pre-assessment, in-assessment, and post-assessment stages. Building on this framework, we advocate for four strategic approaches to facilitate deliberate design and effective implementation of AI selection systems: promoting human\u2013AI joint decision-making, providing transparency of AI involvement and explanations of AI decisions, developing inherently fair AI selection systems, and implementing personalized communication.

    "abstract": "Generative AI and autonomous AI agents are reshaping both the legal employment relationship and the broader social contract between employers and employees. This contract reflects society\u2019s shared expectations about what employers and employees owe each other, including how value is created and distributed and who has authority and accountability for various activities. Unlike prior waves of automation that primarily affected routine tasks, generative AI now touches high-wage, high-status \u201cknowledge\u201d work, altering how expertise is recognized, how decisions are made, and how relationships are formed at work. This paper examines the historical foundations of technological change and employment relations, highlighting how generative AI intensifies existing trends while also introducing new dynamics across six key domains: (1) the role of employee judgment and authority, (2) the value of employee expertise and human-created data, (3) appropriate organizational control and employee autonomy, (4) the nature of work relationships, particularly in the context of AI agents, (5) responsibility for reskilling and career development, and (6) worker collective power. By examining these changing domains, organizational scholars can help explain how generative AI and AI agents are fundamentally altering the social contract of modern employment. \u00a9 Organizational Design Community 2025.",

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of digital technologies is transforming human resource (HR) functions, especially recruitment, where efficiency and fairness are increasingly prioritized. Traditional recruitment practices, involving manual resume screening and subjective interview assessments, are time-consuming, susceptible to bias, and often lack the precision required in a competitive hiring environment. Addressing these limitations, there is a growing demand for innovative, automated approaches that enhance recruitment accuracy and reduce bias. Although Natural Language Processing (NLP) offers promising solutions, existing research often relies on basic keyword matching and sentiment analysis, which do not fully capture the nuanced context or emotional assessments necessary for comprehensive candidate evaluation. This study aims to bridge this gap by developing an advanced NLP framework that combines BERT-based semantic embedding for contextual resume screening and VADER-based sentiment analysis to evaluate candidates\u2019 emotional responses in interviews. Using a sample dataset of 1,000 resumes and 500 interview responses, our model demonstrated high precision (89%) in candidate-job matching and consistent emotional assessment scores, surpassing traditional human-led evaluations in speed and fairness. The findings underscore NLP\u2019s potential to enhance recruitment practices by improving efficiency, reducing subjective bias, and providing data-driven insights for HR professionals. This study contributes to HR practices by advocating the adoption of NLP in recruitment, promoting a fairer, more effective approach to talent acquisition that aligns with the trend toward intelligent, data-centric HR solutions. \u00a9 The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2025.",

While widely applied in domains like finance and healthcare, its potential for fair and transparent employee evaluations in human resources (HR) remains largely untapped. This paper bridges this gap by exploring how general D2T approaches-from rule-based templates to neural architectures like T5 and GPT, which are neural text generation models-could revolutionize HR practices, even as the field lacks direct studies linking these methods to performance evaluation. We outline the strengths and limitations of existing systems in handling heterogeneous data, such as performance metrics and peer reviews, while addressing critical HR concerns like data scarcity, bias amplification, and employee privacy. Though exploratory, applications like automated appraisal summaries and bias audits in feedback systems demonstrate tangible pathways for adoption. However, progress hinges on interdisciplinary collaboration to develop HR-specific benchmarks, ethical safeguards, and adaptable solutions for organizations with limited data. By reimagining D2T as a tool for accountability and equity, this work urges researchers and practitioners to prioritize human-centered innovation, ensuring automated evaluations enhance, not undermine, workplace trust and growth. These approaches could also contribute to a more transparent and trust-based workplace culture, improving employee engagement and organizational cohesion. \u00a9 2025 IEEE.",

    "abstract": "This study explores the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in organizational change management, particularly its role in reducing resistance to change and strengthening employee engagement. At a time when transformation processes are increasingly influenced by digitalization, this research questions how AI can optimize the management of change in companies. Using a quantitative research model, this study explores the effect of AI on resistance to change and strengthening employee engagement in transformation processes. Five research hypotheses were tested using a regression analysis on a sample of 68 Moroccan companies engaged or likely to be engaged in organizational transformation processes and using or considering using tools artificial intelligence. Findings suggest that AI enables predicting resistance and adjusting support programs through behavioral analysis and intervening personalization. Smart platforms also support targeted and transparent communication by automating repetitive change processes. However, there still exists some uncertainty regarding data confidentiality and the need for training on these tools. At the theoretical level, this research enhances understanding of the link between digital technologies and human resource management. At a practical level, it gives advice for the embedding of AI into the processes of organizational transformation within the wider field of ethical and human considerations. \u00a9 2025 IEEE.",

    "abstract": "Incorporating technology into human resource management is at an advanced stage and is revolutionizing the existing environment of human resources. The study examines how human resource management processes can be optimized using artificial intelligence. A survey research design is employed by administering a questionnaire to the participants. The study population comprises employees of top HR outsourcing firms in five different cities in Ukraine. The stratified purposive sampling technique was deployed in drawing samples from the five cities using Raosoft sample size calculator, which gives a sample size of one hundred and sixteen (116) participants. Data collection was achieved with structured questionnaires to provide answers to research questions. We employed descriptive analysis of tables and regression analysis. The result revealed that efficiency at work can be improved with artificial intelligence in human resource management and decision-making. Also, artificial intelligence is germane to the process of human resource management. However, artificial intelligence suffers limitations in the areas of ethical consideration. \u00a9 The Author 2025.

This experiment tests how potential job applicants perceive hiring decisions based on outcome (acceptance or rejection), decision source (algorithm, hiring manager, hiring manager using algorithmic data), and description (none, definitional, or debiasing) with 246 working-age adults in the United States. Drawing on hiring literature and the machine heuristic, we pose hypotheses about how variations in decision outcome, source, and description will be received by participants. Results confirm that rejections are seen as less fair, objective, and capable of accounting for participant uniqueness than job acceptances. Further, for hiring managers and hiring managers using algorithmic data, providing no description of the process is seen as less fair than offering definitional descriptions, and descriptions of debiasing lead to the highest evaluations. However, a boomerang effect emerged for algorithms accompanied by a debiasing statement for both fairness and objectivity. Theoretical and practical implications for the machine heuristic and fairness in personnel selection are presented. \u00a9 2025 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

This study highlights how learning and development (L&D) professionals can use AI tools responsibly to support better learning outcomes. Design/methodology/approach This is a conceptual paper. The authors reviewed articles from 2019 to 2024 using Google Scholar, ERIC, JSTOR and EBSCO. They selected studies for their relevance to AI ethics, emotional intelligence and workforce training. Findings AI offers new opportunities for personalized and adaptive learning. However, risks such as bias, hallucination and lack of emotional awareness can harm learner outcomes. A three-pillar framework \u2013 emotion-aware design, ethical integrity and human\u2013AI collaboration \u2013 is proposed to address these concerns and guide ethical AI use in L&D. Research limitations/implications As a conceptual study, this paper does not present empirical findings. Future research should test the framework in diverse learning settings, examining emotional impact, ethical concerns and long-term outcomes. Practical implications L&D professionals should design and use AI tools that balance efficiency, fairness and empathy. Emotionally intelligent systems must support, not replace, human roles in learning. Clear guidelines are needed to monitor emotional accuracy, reduce bias and ensure transparency. Social implications Ethically grounded, emotionally intelligent AI can make workforce learning more human-centered, fair and inclusive. It can also help build trust and safeguard learner well-being. Originality/value This paper contributes a new conceptual framework integrating emotional intelligence with ethical AI in education and training. This paper offers practical and research directions to support responsible, human-centered AI in workforce development. \u00a9 2025 Emerald Publishing Limited",

    "abstract": "Purpose This study aims to address three questions: RQ1 \u2013 What significant changes has generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) brought to human resource (HR) functions? RQ2 \u2013 How can HR professionals sustain a critical role in an organization when GenAI is transforming traditional HR functions? RQ3 \u2013 What research questions can be addressed to support organizations and HR professionals in a new GenAI-empowered work environment? Design/methodology/approach As a critical reflection of the authors\u2019 corporate HR experience and research expertise, a narrative review of purposefully selective relevant literature, industry white papers and news updates across the six stages of the employee lifecycle was carried out to answer RQ1. A provoking reflection was further synthesized to answer RQ2 and RQ3. Findings Three categories of HR duties (those likely and unlikely to be replaced by GenAI and those likely to emerge due to GenAI implications) were synthesized, leading to the advancement of three propositions. Recommendations for HR professionals, organizations and future research were summarized. Research limitations/implications This paper presents a series of specific research questions, inspiring new research ideas that help organizations improve HR work with GenAI-empowered tools while mitigating its negative impacts. Practical implications This paper proposes detailed recommendations to help HR professionals maintain their critical roles within the organization. In addition to hospitality and tourism businesses, for-profit or nonprofit organizations across all sectors can refer to the answers to RQ1 to restructure their HR departments. Social implications Beyond the HR profession, this work signals a broader societal shift in job functions and structures, urging individuals and organizations to rethink what is needed in the new GenAI-empowered work environments. It also raises awareness of the need for human oversight and responsible AI governance in redesigning future work and organizational structures.

While prior studies have examined various digital technologies in personnel selection, they have not provided sufficient evidence on the different levels of digitalization in selection processes and the factors influencing organizations\u2019 adoption decisions. To address these gaps, this study systematically reviews 94 Scopus-indexed studies to analyze how DT technologies are applied across selection stages, categorizing practices into Manual, Digitalized, and Digitally Transformed approaches. By further distinguishing between Digital Technologies and AI Enhancements, this study offers a structured framework for understanding how organizations integrate digital technologies into selection and what drives or hinders their adoption. The findings highlight both the benefits (efficiency gains, potential bias reduction, improved candidate experience) and challenges (ethical concerns, algorithmic bias, technical and cultural barriers, and candidate perceptions) associated with these technologies, providing insights for both academic research and HR practice. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2025.

Many organizations now include AI in their hiring protocols to mitigate these biases and increase efficiency. However, AI itself can have biases baked-in. Human biases and AI biases are distinct but related; here, we examine how human and AI biases interact to affect hiring outcomes. Through an online experiment, we examine this question in the context of gendered hiring for a male-dominated leadership position in electrical engineering. The study tests how elevated and depressed AI recommendations for male and female job candidates affect participant evaluations of those candidates, moderated by participants\u2019 attitudes about gender. Findings show that all else constant, elevated AI recommendations increased participants\u2019 evaluations of candidates for both competence and likeability, while depressed AI recommendations decreased participants\u2019 ratings on both dimensions. However, the benefits of AI recommendations did not distribute evenly. High AI scores benefited male candidates more than female candidates. Ratings were also affected by participants\u2019 gender attitudes, revealing effects of sexism on hiring decisions, even when AI is involved. These preliminary findings offer insight into the intersection of human and AI biases as they influence hiring outcomes. \u00a92025 IEEE.",

Despite the growing adoption of AI-driven tools, organizations face numerous challenges, including resistance from HR professionals, ethical concerns and data privacy issues. This transformation has sparked significant academic interest, yet several gaps remain in understanding how AI affects HRM practices and organizational outcomes. Objective: This study aims to explore the integration of AI in HRM by analysing its potential opportunities and challenges. Additionally, it investigates how human-AI collaboration can enhance HR functions and drive organizational performance. Methods: A systematic literature review approach was adopted, focusing on 141 recent peer-reviewed articles from Scopus-indexed journals. This review focused on studies published between 2019 and 2025. The analysis was structured around three key dimensions: AI-driven opportunities, challenges associated with AI adoption and its transformative impact on HRM practices. Results: The findings reveal that AI offers significant benefits in HRM, such as improving efficiency, reducing bias and enhancing employee engagement. However, challenges remain regarding ethical decision-making, data security and maintaining human interaction in HR processes. The study also highlights the importance of augmenting, rather than replacing, human roles with AI tools to achieve optimal outcomes. Conclusion: AI has the potential to reshape HRM by streamlining processes and enhancing decision-making. Nevertheless, its successful implementation requires addressing critical challenges such as resistance to change, ethical concerns and legal risks. Organizations should focus on fostering human-AI collaboration to unlock the full potential of AI-driven HRM. \u00a9 2025 by the author(s).",

We examined algorithmic bias in both organizational algorithms (e.g., healthcare, hiring) and individual-use algorithms (e.g., search engines and facial filters). Quantitative analysis showed that participants perceived organizational algorithms as riskier than individual-use algorithms, while feeling less capable of addressing bias in organizational algorithms. Qualitative analysis revealed four key risk dimensions (i.e., mental health, privacy and exploitation, fairness and discrimination, and segmentation and polarization) and three types of efficacy beliefs (i.e., feelings of powerlessness, strategic consumption, and collective responsibility for mitigating bias). While quantitative data showed no significant racial/ethnic differences in risk perceptions, qualitative findings suggested that people of color may adopt avoidant attitudes toward algorithmic systems, potentially missing beneficial opportunities. Gender differences also emerged, with male participants reporting higher efficacy in managing individual-use algorithmic bias and perceiving greater risk in organizational algorithms. \u00a9 2025 The Author(s).

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming industrial-organizational psychology and human resource management, with one of their most promising applications being automatic item generation (AIG) for psychological test development. Although recent advances in LLM-based AIG\u2014particularly for non-cognitive assessments such as personality\u2014 show significant potential, ensuring rigorous quality control remains a persistent challenge. This study introduces a novel AIG framework, the LLM-based Multi-agent AIG system (LM-AIG), where each agent is responsible for different stages of item development, including item generation, content review, linguistic evaluation, bias assessment, and item revision. The LM-AIG also incorporates human feedback to enhance item quality. We implemented the LM-AIG framework using the open-source tool AutoGen to generate items assessing attitudes toward the use of AI in the workplace. To evaluate the quality of the generated items, we conducted an empirical study based on structured ratings from human raters, assessing construct relevance, linguistic clarity, appropriate language level, contextual specificity, and potential bias. This paper further discusses the role of human-in-the-loop mechanisms within the LM-AIG system and outlines future research directions. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2025.",

    "abstract": "As predictive artificial intelligence (AI) technologies increasingly steer workplace decisions, debates around fairness have intensified. Existing research often approaches fairness either as a set of universal principles supported or undermined by algorithms, or as a product of social interpretations, thereby providing either technologically deterministic or purely social accounts. Drawing on an ethnographic study of a human resources (HR) department of a large international company that introduced AI in hiring, this study offers an alternative view that shifts focus to how fairness emerges through the ways people define, embed, and perform values with algorithms. Taking a sociomaterial perspective, we find that the introduction and use of AI resulted in crowding out expert practices of performing fairness, favouring instead the version performed by HR. Our process model explains this outcome by the growing symbiosis between HR's professional mandate for fairness and AI procedures, where each legitimizes, shapes, and protects the other over time. This study thus shows that fairness is not pre-given but constantly redefined and enacted through evolving associations between professional mandates and AI technologies. \u00a9 2025 The Author(s).

    "abstract": "This study analyses how cutting-edge HR technology, such as artificial intelligence (AI), gamification, and immersive tools, can promote diversity, employee empowerment, and organizational productivity. Even though technology is widely used in HR procedures, little is known about how it affects inclusion and bias correction, leaving a significant study gap. In order to close this gap, the study looks at how these technologies affect the dynamics of a diverse workforce, paying particular attention to gender and generational disparities. A structured questionnaire was used to gather data from 248 employees.

    "abstract": "This case study examines the implementation of AI-driven recruitment systems in the hospitality industry through Global Hotel Group\u2019s experience, highlighting the tension between operational efficiency and maintaining human touch in hiring processes. Operating over 200 hotels across 35 countries, Global Hotel Group invested $1.2\u2009million in AI recruitment technology to address challenges in talent acquisition and retention. While the system reduced hiring time from 30 to 3\u2009days and generated $500,000 in annual savings, it also revealed significant challenges in maintaining the company\u2019s cultural values and commitment to diversity. The implementation resulted in mixed outcomes: increased female hiring rates (35%\u201342%) but decreased representation from non-traditional educational backgrounds (40%\u201334%) and lower retention rates (68%\u201362%). Through the lens of Perceived Organizational Justice and Technology-Organization-Environment frameworks, the study explores how AI recruitment systems impact candidate experience, organizational culture, and operational effectiveness. The case highlights specific incidents, including Ahmed Khalil\u2019s experience and a whistleblower event that exposed system biases, demonstrating the complexities of balancing technological efficiency with human-centered hiring practices. As Global Hotel Group prepares for its flagship Dubai hotel opening amid growing competition from Regal Hotels\u2019 successful hybrid recruitment model, the company faces critical decisions about its recruitment strategy. The study concludes by presenting three potential paths forward: maintaining the full AI system with improvements, adopting a hybrid model, or recalibrating the entire approach with enhanced bias mitigation strategies. This analysis provides valuable insights for hospitality organizations navigating the integration of AI in recruitment while maintaining their commitment to personalized service and cultural values. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2025",

How to improve employee engagement and performance in the new era is an important issue in enterprise management. Grounded in the Group Engagement Model (GEM), this study investigates the impact of various dimensions of employee compensation fairness (CF) on task performance (TP) via emotional engagement (EE), with emotional intelligence (EI) and artificial intelligence adoption (AIA) as moderators. This study employs structural equation modeling and three-way interaction analysis to examine data from 311 employees in Chinese media enterprises. The results indicate that distributive fairness (DF), procedural fairness (PF), and interactional fairness (IF) are positively associated with EE, which is positively linked to TP. Among the three dimensions of CF, DF demonstrated the strongest positive relationship with EE, and PF exhibited the largest total effect on TP. The moderating effect of EI on the relationship between IF and EE is significantly and positively related to AIA; and the moderated-moderated mediation effects exists. These findings extend the GEM and suggest enterprise managers should tailor their compensation systems and technology strategies, foster a favorable working environment, to enhance employee productivity, and promote sustainable development of the enterprise. \u00a9 2025 The Author(s).

However, the integration of GenAI in HRM introduces significant risks, such as ethical concerns, bias, privacy issues, and potential disruptions to traditional HR roles, which could undermine the intended benefits unless properly managed. This paper proposes an integrated risk analysis approach, leveraging Leavitt\u2019s Diamond model to systematically identify, assess, and manage the risks associated with the use of GenAI in HRM. Through a comprehensive literature review and the Delphi method involving HR professionals, we construct a detailed risk map that highlights critical risks. Actionable risk mitigation strategies are proposed using an integrated GenAI risk management model that effectively synthesizes risk prioritizing, controlling, and monitoring. This research contributes to the understanding of how to effectively deploy GenAI in HRM while safeguarding organisational integrity and employee well-being, offering valuable insights for academics, HR practitioners, and policymakers. \u00a9 2025 The Author(s).

A mixed-method approach was applied, combining linguistic analysis (using NVivo software) with a covert experiment conducted during workshop sessions. The research sample consisted of students from the international branches of the Staropolska Akademia Nauk Stosowanych, and the study was carried out in Poland, Ireland, and Ukraine. The participants were students of management, economics, finance, and accounting. Out of 405 analyzed CVs, a total of 225 documents were selected that contained phrases characteristic of content generated by AI tools. The participants (139 women and 86 men), aged 19-35, were observed in practical conditions. The results revealed a clear gap between declarations and actual skills-only punctuality and fear of being exposed were statistically significant predictors of credibility. The study also identified the phenomenon of \u201caestheticization of professional identity\u201d, meaning a focus on form over substance. These findings raise important questions about the ethical and practical implications of using AI in recruitment processes. \u00a9 2025 The Author(s).",

    "abstract": "The paper covers the issue concerning the current recruitment systems in higher education, a European-level starting point of the reform launched by the Bologna Process in 1999. The Bologna Process was born in 1999 as an intergovernmental collaboration agreement in the higher education system. Its objective was to build a European higher education area based on principles and criteria shared between the participating countries. Twenty-five years after the agreement came into force, it is possible to take stock of the effects that European rules have had on the processes of hiring teaching staff (researchers, associate professors and full professors). While on the one hand the reform has introduced a standardization of processes (strength), on the other hand some critical issues (weaknesses) have been identified. The current recruitment systems in higher education are unsatisfactory, due to repeated gaps in the ethical profiles of the procedures, which have produced two collateral effects: 1) an increase in administrative appeals and 2) an increase in the average age of successful candidates. The paper proposes an innovative and theoretical e-recruitment model named NCHE-4-R-AP-FP to overcome these critical issues. The model identifies the need to transform the present procedures from non-comparative procedures to comparative procedures, should change its name and become the reference procedure for all three academic levels. Therefore, it would be possible to foresee the creation of 1) a comparative procedure for researchers, which should evaluate only research activity; 2) a comparative procedure for full and associate professors, which should evaluate research, teaching, institutional and third mission activities (with the exclusion for the latter of those already included in research activity, such as patents). The fundamental differences between the model and existing ones are: 1) AI integrated into current e-government processes, 2) abolition of physical evaluation committees and 3) transformation of recruitment processes into e-recruitment processes. The advantages of the proposed model consist in overcoming the previously exposed critical issues, although the most archaic academic system itself will probably advance the greatest resistance to the proposal. \u00a9 2025 by the authors.",

Here, we construe organizations\u2019 use of algorithmic control as a signal to potential applicants about the organization\u2019s reputation. Drawing on signaling theory, we suggest a receiver-centric approach to the interpretation of algorithmic control signals. More specifically, we argue that individuals\u2019 lay beliefs about Artificial Intelligence (AI) affect how they infer organizational values from the degree of algorithmic control, such that individuals who are more skeptical (vs. optimistic) about AI are more likely to interpret algorithmic control as a negative (vs. a positive) signal, which in turn relates to individuals\u2019 intention to accept a job offer. We test our model with two experimental studies (N = 402 and N = 440). As expected, lay beliefs about AI moderated the indirect effects of higher degrees of algorithmic control on the job acceptance intention via perceived trust in employees, and the bias and consistency factor of procedural justice, but not via the voice and morality factor of procedural justice.

One of the most affected areas is human resource management (HRM), where AI enhances employee experiences, reduces turnover, and mitigates recruitment biases. As businesses increasingly invest in AIpowered HR solutions, the need for a structured framework to evaluate their business value has become evident. Despite growing research on AI, the study of AI-driven HR remains in its early stages, with no established framework for assessing its business value. This study addresses this gap by developing a comprehensive evaluation framework. Using a qualitative approach, it integrates a literature review with focus group discussions involving five domain experts. The proposed framework consists of three core components: (1) the assessment process (Plan, Do, Review, Act), (2) assessment criteria (Financial, Operational/Functional, User, Social/Ethical), and (3) stakeholder analysis (Internal and External stakeholders). The findings equip HR managers with a structured tool to assess AI implementations, identify strengths and weaknesses, and develop strategic improvement plans. By applying this framework, managers can gain deeper insights into the value of AI-powered HR investments and make more informed decisions. \u00a9 2025 IEEE.",

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly integrating into decision-making across fields like finance, healthcare, and criminal justice. However, its widespread use brings ethical challenges, especially the potential for bias in AI algorithms. This paper examines these ethical concerns, emphasizing three main types of bias: data bias, algorithmic bias, and interaction biasThrough real-world case studies, including biased facial recognition systems, hiring algorithms, and criminal justice AI tools, this paper highlights the far-reaching societal impact of these biases. These case studies demonstrate how bias in AI systems can result in unequal access to resources, unjust treatment in legal systems, and perpetuation of stereotypes in employment practices. This paper highlights the pressing need for robust strategies to address the ethical risks associated with AI. It delves into established frameworks such as Ethically Aligned AI, the EU Guidelines on Trustworthy AI, and the Toronto Declaration, offering essential principles for creating AI systems that prioritize fairness, transparency, and accountability. By evaluating current applications across different industries, this paper proposes actionable solutions to reduce bias in AI systems and also a sample model has been developed to represent how the system has to be under ethics and including enhancing data diversity and implementing robust governance mechanisms to ensure ethical oversight in resume screening processThis research seeks to advance the conversation on ethical AI by emphasizing fairness, equity, and the social good, ensuring that AI technologies are developed to benefit all communities equally. \u00a9 2025 IEEE.",

    "abstract": "This study proposes a novel machine learning-based employee classification system to address the critical challenge of employee attrition, offering significant advancements in workforce management. Leveraging a dataset from XYZ Corporation, the system employs advanced machine learning techniques to predict employee turnover with high accuracy and interpretability. The XGBoost model emerged as the best-performing algorithm, achieving an accuracy of 92.3%, a precision of 89.7%, and an F1-score of 90.6%. Key predictors of attrition, such as job satisfaction, work-life balance, and compensation, were identified using SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations) values, enabling HR professionals to understand and address the underlying drivers of turnover. A key innovation of this research is the integration of fairness-aware techniques, such as re-weighting and adversarial debiasing, to mitigate bias in employee classification. This ensures equitable predictions across demographic groups, promoting ethical and transparent workforce analytics. Additionally, a decision support system was developed to provide HR teams with real-time insights and personalized retention strategies, enabling proactive interventions for high-risk employees. The findings demonstrate the superiority of machine learning over traditional methods, such as logistic regression, which achieved only 85.2% accuracy. By combining predictive accuracy, explainability, and fairness, this research advances the field of AI-driven workforce management. The proposed system has significant implications for improving employee retention, reducing turnover costs, and fostering data-driven HR decision-making. Future work could explore scalability across industries and the long-term impact of personalized retention strategies on organizational performance. \u00a9 2025 IEEE.",

    "abstract": "This article presents a reliable AI-based psychometric assessment system using multimodal signal data such as EEG signals, speech, and structured psychometric questionnaires. Conventional psychometric testing depends on unobjective self-reporting processes without real-time flexibility. Relying on machine learning and deep learning combination, the suggested system overcomes such limitations and optimizes the precision of psychological examinations. CNN-LSTM architectures are used for emotion recognition from EEG and speech with the ability of temporal and spatial dependency extraction, and XGBoost for prediction of Big Five personality traits based on structured questionnaire responses. The approach includes modality-specific designed preprocessing pipelines, efficient feature extraction, and late fusion ensemble models for better decision-making. Data were taken from three publicly available datasets: DEAP (EEG), IEMOCAP (speech), and a psychometric dataset for the OCEAN model. Experiments yielded impressive results: 97% accuracy for EEG emotion estimation, 88.5% accuracy for speech emotion recognition, and 94.3% accuracy for the multimodal fusion model. These results demonstrate the power of multimodal fusion in psychometric assessment. The system is scalable and adaptable, suitable for use in mental health diagnosis, workplace assessment, education, and AI-augmented recruitment systems. Furthermore, it offers real-time feedback and minimizes bias, making it a promising tool for continuous psychological monitoring. Overall, this framework provides a guideline to create intelligent, ethical, and interpretable AI systems that are able to integrate physiological signals and psychological profiling within an operational environment. \u00a9 2025 IEEE.",

    "abstract": "The main aim of this research is to examine the impact of AI awareness on the intention of employees in five-star hotels in Egypt to leave their jobs, with a focus on understanding the mediating roles of job burnout and psychological contract breach in this relationship. To evaluate the proposed model, 303 responses from full-time employees in five-star hotels were analyzed using the PLS-SEM approach. The results indicate that AI Awareness significantly contributes to increased employee intention to leave, job burnout, and perceived psychological contract breach. Additionally, both job burnout and perceived psychological contract breach have a positive effect on employees' intention to leave. The study further highlights the mediating role of AI awareness in influencing intention to leave through job burnout and perceived psychological contract breach. This study makes significant theoretical contributions by revealing how AI awareness influences employee turnover through psychological and emotional mechanisms, rather than direct causality. It extends existing theories by showing that AI awareness triggers burnout and perceptions of psychological contract breach, which in turn affect turnover intentions. This insight enriches our understanding of how technological change impacts employee attitudes, especially in technology-sensitive sectors like hospitality. The study also broadens job burnout theory by introducing AI-induced stressors such as job displacement fears and lack of control. Additionally, it advances psychological contract theory by illustrating how AI alters employees\u2019 perceptions of job security, fairness, and career progression. These shifts can undermine trust and commitment, highlighting the need for clear communication during AI implementation. From an HRM perspective, the findings stress the importance of evolving practices to address both technical and emotional employee needs. Practically, hotel managers should communicate transparently about AI\u2019s role to reduce insecurity and encourage buy-in. Offering AI-focused skill development can ease fears of redundancy and boost job satisfaction. Burnout should be managed through wellness programs, mental health support, and promoting work-life balance. Involving employees in AI decisions enhances their sense of control and fairness. Trust-building and ethical transparency are vital for maintaining psychological safety. Providing career development paths within an AI-enhanced environment reinforces employees\u2019 long-term organizational value. Finally, a supportive, fair workplace fosters engagement and reduces turnover intentions in an AI-driven future. \u00a9 2025 Editura Universitatii din Oradea. All rights reserved.",

A well-established phenomenon in teamwork research is the tendency of individuals to attribute positive outcomes to themselves and negative ones to other teammates, commonly referred to as self-serving attributions. Drawing on attribution theory and research on automation bias, we conduct two experiments (N=397) to explore the relationship between outcome (positive vs. negative) and internal attribution in human-AI teams. We consider the role of task type (logical vs. creative), hypothesizing that automation bias interferes with self-serving attributions in logical tasks. Results reveal differences in internal attributions between creative and logical tasks in human-AI teams, but not in human-only teams. In human-AI teams, we observe reversed self-serving attributions for logical (but not creative) tasks, indicating that individuals attribute failure more internally than success. We further demonstrate that these reversed self-serving attributions result from automation bias. Finally, we identify the negative impact of this attributional pattern on achievement emotions. Our study contributes to theory by identifying a boundary condition for self-serving attributions in human-AI teams. On a practical level, we provide insights on appropriate task design and management of human-AI teams. \u00a9 2025, Academy of Management. All rights reserved.",

    "abstract": "This chapter examines the conditions under which AI-based decision support tools can effectively assist Human Resource (HR)/line managers in achieving the organisational DEI goals. The analysis contributes to the discourse on addressing the challenges of neglecting minorities either caused by biases of human decision-makers or by AI tools. The findings are based on qualitative interviews with 13 HR/line managers in Australia and Germany. The study reveals that the reasons for implementing AI decision support tools and the antecedents leading to diversity-increasing user behaviour need to be considered separately. Mitigating risk factors such as technical biases is crucial before purchasing AI. When AI-supported tools are used for recruitment decisions, achieving DEI goals depends on the purpose of AI usage (quantitative or qualitative needs), the diversity consciousness, and AI literacy of the users. It is not the tool itself but the human-AI interaction that makes the difference. \u00a9 The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2025.",

Research purpose: This study aims to systematically review and analyse the literature on AI\u2019s current integration into HRM practices across industries, focusing on studies published from 2020 to 2024. Motivation for the study: The motivation for this study was to identify both key benefits and possible limitations in the current employment of AI in HRM practices with a view to making recommendations for the optimal deployment of AI tools. Research approach/design and method: This study utilises the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) approach. Data sources include Google Scholar, Scopus and ScienceDirect. Main findings: Findings reveal that while AI tools may significantly increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the hiring process, potentially enhance the accuracy and objectivity of performance appraisals and enable the implementation of more personalised training and development initiatives, several ethical implications and challenges remain. These include potential biases within AI algorithms, concerns about data privacy and over-surveillance of employees, along with exacerbating the \u2018digital divide\u2019 between those with access to technology and those without. The research also notes the limitations of concrete, quantifiable, metrics available in the literature thus far, for the extent of the benefits claimed. Practical/managerial implications: The study offers recommendations for organisations to maximise the benefits of AI while addressing its associated challenges. Contribution/value-add: The need for robust regulatory frameworks and best practices to ensure AI\u2019s ethical deployment is clearly indicated. The findings aim to guide HR practitioners, policymakers and researchers in developing effective strategies for integrating AI into HRM practices ethically and responsibly while noting the current uncertainties regarding its concrete benefits and dangers. \u00a9 2025.

In theory, using AI in recruitment streamlines processes and saves valuable time for hiring teams. Yet, concerns remain about whether automated methods are truly fair and equitable. AI can inadvertently encode biases tied to demographic factors such as race and gender, prompting organizations to explore Explainable AI for greater transparency. However, hidden biases may persist undetected, even when personal information is removed. These details can threaten the integrity of our hiring practices and often slip beneath our awareness. Our work explores these overlooked biases, offering insights and strategies to foster more ethical, inclusive recruitment processes. In this paper, we conduct a controlled experiment using a Large Language Modelsbased recruitment tool to quantify how subtle resume variations can influence candidate evaluations. By isolating factors such as 'career gaps' and 'keyword usage', we highlight overlooked biases that can significantly alter AIdriven hiring outcomes. Our work explores these overlooked biases, offering insights and strategies to foster more ethical, inclusive recruitment processes.

Design/methodology/approach: Adopting a qualitative and inductive research design, the study combines the analysis of policy and strategy documents with data from four exploratory focus groups and 43 semi-structured interviews with public managers. Findings: The study identifies four mechanisms through which AI enhances resilience in PAs. First, the integration of AI into HRM improves recruitment, training, and performance management. Second, the development of key managerial competencies\u2014including strategic thinking, change management, and emotional intelligence\u2014supports effective AI adoption. Third, overcoming cultural and structural barriers, such as resistance to change and digital skill gaps, enables transformation. Fourth, the use of AI-driven tools strengthens crisis response, operational efficiency, and employee engagement. Together, these mechanisms foster adaptability and long-term resilience, highlighting the strategic role of AI-enabled HRM in the public sector. Practical implications: The findings offer practical recommendations for PA leaders, emphasizing the importance of AI-enabled HRM systems, continuous managerial development, and strategic actions to overcome implementation barriers. These insights provide a comprehensive roadmap for enhancing adaptability, efficiency, and resilience in public sector organizations\u2014encompassing smart investments, leadership development, a supportive work culture, ethical governance, and infrastructure modernization. Originality/value: This study advances the literature on AI adoption in PA by offering a nuanced, empirically grounded perspective on how AI-driven HRM practices and managerial competencies interact to shape organizational resilience. \u00a9 2025, Emerald Publishing Limited.",

However, firms must cultivate employee trust to integrate AI into HR procedures. The main goals of this study are to identify the crucial aspects impacting employee trust in AI-enabled HR tools and to explore commercial applications of AI for crucial HR tasks. The goal is to increase employee trust in AI-driven HR systems. The study uses a mixed-method approach, including surveys and interviews, to conceptualize and highlight feedback mechanisms, communication tactics, and employee involvement in fostering trust. This study systematically examines the factors influencing employee trust in AI-driven HR systems, establishing a robust positive correlation between trust and the effectiveness of training interventions (r = 0.683). The findings demonstrate that employees who are younger and more highly educated generally exhibit higher levels of trust in AI technologies. Additionally, concerns regarding algorithmic bias are notably more pronounced among female respondents. These results highlight the critical need for organizations to implement targeted, comprehensive training programs to address the ethical dimensions of AI and mitigate biases inherent in these systems. By prioritizing such initiatives, organizations can foster a culture of transparency and trust, thereby driving enhanced employee engagement, facilitating greater acceptance of AI technologies, and ultimately optimizing organizational performance. \u00a9 2025 IEEE.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the relationship between algorithmic management (AM) and employee engagement is crucial as AM increasingly reshapes traditional workplaces beyond the gig economy. Unlike gig settings characterized by transactional, short-term exchanges, traditional employment relationships rely heavily on social reciprocity and trust. Drawing on social exchange theory (SET), this research contributes by explaining why and how AM fundamentally restructure these traditional social dynamics. Two studies were conducted: Study 1 (N = 304) employed a cross-sectional field design, revealing that AM weakens social exchange while reinforcing economic exchange, thereby reducing employee engagement. Study 2 (N = 410) experimentally replicated these findings, established causality, and demonstrated that leader social distance critically moderates these effects. Specifically, in low-AM environments, a proximal leader reinforces social exchange, whereas in high-AM environments, leader proximity attenuates economic exchange. These findings highlight AM\u2019s contingent impacts on engagement, demonstrating that AM actively reduces interpersonal reciprocity and trust. Thus, rather than functioning merely as a neutral technological tool, AM emerges as a central force redefining traditional employer-employee relationships. Theoretical and practical implications for human resource management are discussed. \u00a9 2025 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

We argue that AI's unparalleled data-processing and analytical capabilities offer enhanced operational efficiency, strategic decision-making and personalised employee experiences despite significant challenges associated with this transformation, including ethical concerns. The widespread adoption of AI raises additional risks such as the potential de-skilling of HR practitioners, threats to data privacy, employee anxieties and adverse effects on overall well-being. We suggest that these challenges underscore the need for a cautious and balanced approach, particularly as emerging technologies associated with the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) redefine workplace dynamics. We suggest that effective AI integration requires HR leaders to address their own skills gaps, establish robust ethical governance frameworks and build organisational trust, thus, ultimately harnessing AI's disruptive potential as an enabler of innovation, equity and competitive-edge development. \u00a9 2025 selection and editorial matter, David G.

    "abstract": "Purpose: As artificial intelligence (AI) has become increasingly accessible, a growing number of organizations have begun to adopt AI in hiring. Despite the increasing use of AI in hiring, little is known about how organizations can effectively communicate with their stakeholders about their AI use. Using gain and loss message frames and organization\u2013public relationships (OPRs) as theoretical frameworks, this study tests the impact of exposure to job advertisements that address AI use on individuals\u2019 attitudes and behaviors toward organizations using AI during hiring. Design/methodology/approach: We conducted a 2 (message frames: gain vs loss)\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02 (benefits of using AI in hiring: faster hiring process vs reduced unconscious hiring bias) between-subjects experiment using a Prolific online panel (N\u00a0=\u00a0224). Participants were randomly assigned to one of four conditions and viewed a fictitious company\u2019s job advertisement that varied in message frames and benefits of using AI. After viewing the experimental stimuli, participants answered questions about OPRs, attitudes toward the company and positive word-of-mouth (WOM) intentions. Findings: Loss-framed messages appeared as more effective in increasing OPRs, favorable attitudes toward the company and positive WOM intentions. OPRs positively mediated the impact of exposure to loss-framed job advertisements on attitudes and positive WOM intentions. The benefits of using AI in hiring moderated the impact of loss-framed messages on OPRs, attitudes and positive WOM intentions. Practical implications: This study offers important practical implications for organizations that use AI technology in their hiring practices or are interested in incorporating AI into their hiring processes. The significant impact of loss-framed messages suggests that organizations should highlight the anticipated negative outcomes of not using AI rather than addressing the positive outcomes from AI use. The findings align with established negativity bias research in framing literature, demonstrating individuals\u2019 greater susceptibility to negative information and adverse outcomes in persuasive contexts. The moderating effect of the benefits of using AI in hiring indicates that the impact of message frames on individuals\u2019 attitudinal and behavioral responses to organizations\u2019 AI use varies depending on organizations\u2019 rationale for using AI. Originality/value: This study is one of the early studies to examine individuals\u2019 attitudinal and behavioral responses to organizations\u2019 use of AI in hiring. Prior research suggests that OPRs mediate the relationship between individuals\u2019 exposure to organizational messages and their attitudes toward organizations. Extending this line of inquiry, the current study explores OPRs\u2019 mediating role in the context of AI-driven hiring processes and investigates how OPRs mediate the relationships between organizations\u2019 message framing strategies and individuals\u2019 attitudes toward the organization as well as their WOM intentions. By examining the effectiveness of gain- and loss-framed job advertisements, this study offers important insights for organizations on how to more effectively and ethically communicate about AI use with their stakeholders. \u00a9 2025, Emerald Publishing Limited.",

    "abstract": "Indeed, the system employs Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to identify the main features in the resume, including skills, education, and work experience. It then compares these features with the job description by means of semantic similarity methods, such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency) and BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) embeddings. The ranking engine uses weighted scoring algorithms that prioritize the relevancy of resumes. Further, the system also needs the user to upload their resume and job description through the web-based interface where the output will display that a listing has been generated and is listed to be gone through with the candidates. They evaluate the performance of the system by means of evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR). In their results, it shows that BERT based semantic matching has proved better than the conventional keyword-based methods as far as accuracy and efficiency in screening resumes is concerned. What makes the current study noteworthy is that artificial intelligence (AI) could help improve recruiting automation and point to ways of streamlining the hiring process. This will bring significant reductions to bias and further improve the fairness and effectiveness of selecting a candidate. Further work contemplates multi-lingual support, domain-specific customizations, and integration of the system to Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) to increase the importance of this study in real-world terms. \u00a9 2025 IEEE.",

This article will systematically review the role of AI in HRM, focusing on applications related to recruitment, employee engagement, workforce planning, and retention. This systematic review article underlines the significant benefits of AI adoption by analyzing ten peer-reviewed studies using advanced statistical analysis. These benefits include efficiency gains, increased employee satisfaction, and strategic workforce optimization. Yet, there are significant challenges in the form of algorithmic bias, data privacy concerns, and organizational readiness. Regression and correlation analyses show a strong positive relationship between AI use and HR performance metrics, with a greater effect on recruitment and retention. Though AI has a huge potential for transformation, the findings have brought into focus the need for ethical guidelines, strong data protection, and employee upskilling for the full realization of AI's capabilities in HRM.

    "abstract": "The evolution of the PMS has undergone a significant transformation over the last century. PMSs have historically focussed on measuring, evaluating, and enhancing the performance of employees within organizations. The performance appraisal method was first presented by F.W. Taylor in 1914 with an emphasis on worker productivity, beginning the PMS\u2019s timeline. In 1930, Walter D. Scott\u2019s performance appraisal process was employed by many companies. In 1960, Performance appraisals used to be done as annual confidential reports that contained significant information about employees\u2019 performance. In 1980, multi-purpose evaluation became popular as 360-degree performance appraisal. In 2000, strategic performance appraisal took the edge where individual objectives were aligned with organizational objectives. By 2023, digitalization will transform the PMS. The review will take a shift from yearly or quarterly feedback to ongoing, real-time feedback. The focus of the evaluation will change from quantity to quality. The emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) will bring a paradigm shift in the performance management of employees. Tools powered by AI will facilitate real-time tracking, enabling immediate feedback and corrective actions. However, the evolution has not been without challenges. Ethical concerns related to data privacy, algorithm bias, and employee surveillance will arise. Hence, the chapter will provide insights into the journey of PMS from tradition to its current state and the opportunities and challenges associated with the advent of digitalization. \u00a9 2025 selection and editorial matter, Deepa Gupta, Mukul Gupta, Balamurugan Balusamy, Rajesh Kumar Dhanaraj, Parth Mukul Gupta; individual chapters, the contributors.",

    "abstract": "Human resource management (HRM) is the management of people inside a company or organization in an effective and efficient manner so that they contribute to their ability to gain a competitive edge. It is designed to optimize employee performance in support of an organization\u2019s strategic objectives. Organizations are using tracking technologies more and more, which enables managers to continuously compile extremely detailed data on worker performance and health. HRM is an elegant way to refer to a people manager. However, it goes a little bit beyond. Most of the firms are dependent on information technology for their survival and technology is having a serious impact on overall HR procedures. Despite predictions to the contrary from the popular media, it is difficult to distinguish between the fanfare around technical advancement and its real potential effects on the workplace. The field of intelligent automation, which includes robotics and artificial intelligence, is rapidly expanding in academia, but our knowledge of the ways in which these technologies impact HRM at the organizational (firm) and individual (employee) levels is still lacking. This study is focused on examining the evidence in relation to the impact of emerging technologies socially, ethically, and legally and also the role of the Human Resource (HR) function in helping employees and organizations to navigate these changes. Additionally, the chapter will be focused on identifying the social, ethical, and legal perspectives of the emerging technologies in HRM. \u00a9 2025 selection and editorial matter, Deepa Gupta, Mukul Gupta, Balamurugan Balusamy, Rajesh Kumar Dhanaraj, Parth Mukul Gupta; individual chapters, the contributors.",

As intelligent systems increasingly monitor and evaluate employee performance, forward-thinking organizations must ensure that AI-driven processes are fair, unbiased, and privacy-conscious to maintain their employer brand value. This chapter examines how XAI strategically transforms talent management, from recruitment through retention, enabling organizations to leverage AI-driven insights while differentiating themselves as employers of choice. By integrating XAI, companies make informed decisions, mitigate bias, creating competitive advantage in the talent marketplace. While XAI offers significant benefits, challenges remain in addressing algorithmic bias and ensuring organizational fairness.

    "abstract": "The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) in recruitment processes marks a transformative shift in human resource management, offering new efficiencies and insights while also introducing challenges and ethical considerations. Furthermore, this study posits a hypothesis that underscores the significance of positive organizational shock as a mediating factor in the relationship between AI adoption in recruitment and career development. This study aims to explore the multifaceted impacts of AI adoption in recruitment, examining how it influences positive organizational shocks and career development. It further seeks to understand how family support and emotional intelligence serve as moderating factors in this dynamic, offering insights that could guide both future research and practical applications in HR technology integration. A quantitative study took place in March 2023 among 246 h directors, HR managers, and HR officers in higher education institutions in Nigeria. SEM-PLS and SPSS were applied for data analysis. The results revealed that emotional intelligence enables educators to manage stress, regulate their emotions, and effectively communicate with colleagues and administrators, fostering a more conducive work environment amidst technological transformations. In the Nigerian higher education context, where interpersonal relationships and collaboration are highly valued, educators with high emotional intelligence may serve as role models for their peers, facilitating the smooth transition towards AI-enhanced recruitment practices and contributing positively to career development initiatives within academic institutions. \u00a9 The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.",

Design/methodology/approach: This study used MANCOVA, followed by mediation and moderated mediation analyses, to test the hypotheses. Findings: This study\u2019s findings suggest that the presence of AI as interviewing agents increases job applicants\u2019 intention to fake job interviews, with the perceived ability of AI vs humans to detect fakeness as a mediator. The conscientiousness of job applicants and warning issuance by the Chief HR officer or CEO moderates the relationship. Originality/value: With the advancement of information technology tools such as AI, job interviews in firms are taken over by AI more than humans. This study pioneers research into the potential for increased faking behaviour by job candidates when interacting with AI interviewers. The current study is also one of the pioneering studies, shining a light on the misuse of IT systems in human resource management practices of organisations. \u00a9 2025, Emerald Publishing Limited.",

This particular research focuses on an AI-based framework that is focused on the use of asynchronous video interviews by means of predicting the Big Five personality traits of candidates with respect to Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities (KSAs), which are otherwise highly relevant to its roles. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were used for feature extraction followed by rule-based mapping, which has resulted in highly accurate predictions, for example, MSE 0.15 levels of prediction for conscientiousness and MSE 0.23 for openness. The mappings of the predicted traits with KSAs, such as a conscientiousness-responsibility link, were validated by industry experts. This study addresses some limitations, one being the restriction of features extracted from the dataset. It also emphasizes ethical recruitment based on AI systems.

This study employs an interdisciplinary approach, drawing from industrial relations and social psychology, to examine the integration of AI in staffing practices. Through qualitative analysis of 30 stakeholder interviews, it develops an inductive theory identifying efficiency, equity, and voice as core objectives shaping effective and responsible AI-based selection systems. The findings reveal that balancing these objectives requires navigating complex internal and external dynamics, culminating in the proposed tri-balance model. This model offers a framework for aligning stakeholder priorities and optimizing AI adoption.

    "abstract": "This paper explores the efficacy of AI-driven chatbots in accurately inferring personality traits compared to traditional psychometric tests within a real-world professional hiring context. The study is driven by the increasing integration of AI tools in recruitment processes, which necessitates a deeper understanding of their reliability and validity. Using a quasi-experimental design with propensity score matching, we analysed data from 159 candidates and other professionals from Serbian and Montenegrin regions who completed both traditional psychometric assessments and AI-based personality evaluations based on the Big Five Personality model. A novel one-question-per-facet approach was employed in the chatbot assessments with a goal of enabling more granular analysis of the chatbot\u2019s psychometric properties. The findings indicate that the chatbot demonstrated good structural, substantive, and convergent validity for certain traits, particularly Extraversion and Conscientiousness, but not for Neuroticism, Agreeableness, and Openness. While robust regression confirmed that AI-inferred scores are less susceptible to social desirability bias than traditional tests, they did not significantly predict real-world outcomes, indicating issues with external validity, particularly predictive validity. The results suggest that AI-driven chatbots show promise for identifying certain personality traits and demonstrate resistance to social desirability bias. This paper contributes to the emerging field of AI and psychometrics by offering insights into the potential and limitations of AI tools in professional selection, while developing an approach for refining psychometric properties of AI-driven assessments. \u00a9 \u00a9 2025 Dukanovic and Krpan.",

The above work proposed and developed a system that exploits the most advanced tools of natural language processing, and recent advances in neural networks to correctly parse resumes and the candidates to jobs descriptions. The system deals with the issues of unstructured resume data, the efficient extraction of the required data, and assessment of the candidate on his/her fitness in the given company in terms of his/her technical competencies and compatibility with the company's work culture. Substantial real life data analysis presented in the paper proves high efficiency and equity of the applications. This research also incorporates the ethical questions as well as the ways of dealing with data privacy regulations and the biases in the historical data by applying the explainable AI methods. A questionnaire to the users of the system, which are the HR professionals further verifies the real-world application and usability of the system based on concepts such as ease of use, precision and time economy. In conclusion, the study adds knowledge to the process of establishing ethical and optimal AI implementations in the field of HRM and results in the improvement of talent recruitment strategies and practices promoting fair hiring decisions. \u00a9 2025 IEEE.",

    "abstract": "Gender bias in hiring is a significant problem in the banking sector. This study explores how individuals\u2019 bias towards hiring males is impacted when those individuals are exposed to existing recommendations with embedded bias towards hiring either males or females. We also investigate whether the impact of these recommendations changes when individuals believe they come from Artificial Intelligence (AI), male partners, or female partners. We perform a 2 \u00d7 3 between-subjects experiment that asks subjects to rank candidates under each condition (existing recommendations favor male candidates vs. existing recommendations favor female candidates, and recommendations come from AI vs. recommendations come from male partners vs. recommendations come from female partners). The results show that subjects tend to imitate the male or female favoring bias in the existing recommendations. Results further show that male and female subjects tended to ignore a bias towards hiring males when it came from the opposite sex. Further, subjects with positive perceptions toward AI were more likely to favor male candidates, reflecting the dynamic of perception of credibility, gender bias, and social identity. These results underline the importance of collaboration between AI developers and HR to mitigate biases and address systemic disparities in recruitment in the banking sector. \u00a9 The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.",

    "abstract": "Human resources (HR) procedures have been drastically altered by artificial intelligence (AI) fast expansion, particularly in the areas of talent acquisition and employee retention. Though they are working hard to develop successful recruitment plans and keep good retention rates, organizations nonetheless struggle with issues including prejudices in decision-making and too high personnel turnover. Among other possible responses, artificial intelligence (AI) might automate administrative chores, offer predictive insights on employee happiness and attrition issues, and simplify candidate screening. In order to improve recruitment and retention rates, this article examines how artificial intelligence (AI) might be included into human resource (HR) systems utilizing predictive models and machine learning techniques. Python using TensorFlow and scikit-learn tools allowed us to create and assess a hybrid artificial intelligence framework. This framework helped to organize data on employee satisfaction and recruiting from many companies. The first tests have demonstrated that the framework precisely projects possible resignations with a 91% accuracy rate and increases recruitment efficiency by 28%. Comparisons with more conventional approaches draw attention to the more exact and affordable HR models augmented with artificial intelligence have been improved with. The significant findings imply that by lowering bias, improving decision-making, and motivating long-term employee involvement, artificial intelligence could support human resource teams. These findings reveal how artificial intelligence could modify human resource practices to attain better performance. \u00a9 2025 IEEE.",

    "abstract": "Background: In the private banking industry, including artificial intelligence (AI) into human resource management (HRM) has completely transformed workforce management. Fast acceptance of digital technologies has driven financial institutions to use artificial intelligence (AI) to improve recruitment, employee training, performance review, and workplace efficiency. With an eye towards the changing dynamics between managers and employees, this paper attempts to investigate how artificial intelligence has impacted human resource management skills and strategies in private banks housed inside Chennai City. Objectives: The study identifies the main barriers related to the acceptance of artificial intelligence. Among these challenges are ethical concerns about data privacy, technological knowledge gaps among HR managers, and change resistance. Data Collection: Data were collected using a mixed-methods approach from 250 employees hired for ten different private banks in Chennai and 120 managers. These banks call Chennai their hometown. We obtained both quantitative and qualitative knowledge of the impact artificial intelligence has in redefining HR practices by means of a survey and semi-structured interviews. Findings: According to the results, many managers-more especially, those in the field of predictive analytics for employee performance-acknowledge artificial intelligence as a required tool for decision-making. Seventy-five percent of employees have reported an increase in their degree of satisfaction with their company thanks to customised training programs driven by artificial intelligence and better strategies for preserving a good work-life balance. Still, 68% of respondents voiced concerns regarding the possibility that artificial intelligence would replace human contacts in HRM systems. \u00a9 2025 IEEE.",

This chapter examines the potential of this technology to change the way HR works, identifying key challenges and best practices for application in HR. It begins with the key AI technologies currently being applied to HR Machine Learning (ML), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Robotic Process Automation (RPA) and some benefits these technologies currently bring, including greater efficiency in recruitment, more personalised engagement with employees, and better performance management. At the same time, there are potentially very significant issues that may constrain the value these technologies can ultimately bring, including poor-quality data, difficulties arising out of privacy and other technical challenges, and ethical matters baked into the technologies themselves, including the bias that can arise with such approaches. To enable readers to overcome these challenges, the chapter presents best practices and optimal solutions in a series of compact sub-sections on topics including strategic planning; data management; AI competence required of HR teams; alignment of AI with HR and the wider business; responsible use of AI; organisational change management; successful examples of AI in HR practice; and evolving AI trends and forecasts for the future of work and HR. In sum, this chapter will be an excellent source of how to use AI intentionally, ethically, and for long-term organisational success. \u00a9 2025 selection and editorial matter, Vidhi Agrawal; individual chapters, the contributors.",

Automation and AI come in handy for human resource practitioners and facilitate them in resolving numerous pervading issues related to talent and skills, engagement and retention, redressal of concerns of employees, impartial matching of jobs for internal as well as potential candidates for career advancements, guiding HR professionals on compensation management/investment, doing away with administrative responsibilities via machine learning process or automation. In this way, AI systems enable managers to create an attractive environment for every worker to enjoy flexitime and facilitate mobility while learning (Guenole & Feinzig, 2019). Nevertheless, applications of AI in the domain of Human Resource Management (HRM) are plagued with serious challenges leading to ethical and legal concerns such as biasness and unfairness, opaqueness, data security, and privacy of employees. Moreover, fear of job loss amongst employees is the most serious allegation of AI. Although, new job roles are also upcoming because of the systems of AI. Therefore, it becomes crucial to develop a conducive environment for the adoption of AI at workplaces along with a legal framework entailing policies, programmes, and practices governing the ethical use of AI systems to provide maximum benefit to all the stakeholders\u2014HR managers, employees, organizations, and society at large. In this direction, the present chapter is a sincere attempt to provide best practices, recommendations, and future directions for policymakers to embrace AI in HRM in a welcoming manner without any resistance highlighting its concept and evolution followed by its functions, applications, challenges, and ethical and legal considerations emerging out of it. \u00a9 2025 selection and editorial matter, Vidhi Agrawal; individual chapters, the contributors.",

This paper introduces FairBERT as a novel approach to reducing the biases in automated English proficiency assessments. The focus here is on improving the validity of proficiency measurement and minimizing the impact of irrelevant demographic factors. FairBERT makes use of adversarial training in a pre-trained BERT model, estimating the proficiency in a language while ensuring at the same time demographic parity. The model focuses on the proficiency of language rather than relying on the detection and removal of demographic markers by training an adversarial component. The effectiveness of FairBERT is demonstrated by its validation on a learner text corpus with an accuracy rate of 95.5%, as against 82.3% for basic BERT and 75.8% for traditional classifiers. These results demonstrate that FairBERT can offer more accurate, unbiased assessments without giving up on fairness. Thus, by dealing with the biases in English proficiency tests, FairBERT offers an encouraging solution for education, recruitment, and immigration, ensuring a more balanced evaluation process. \u00a9 2025 IEEE.",

The research seeks to understand how generative AI can transform learning processes, enhance employee development and address potential obstacles in implementation. Design/methodology/approach: The research uses semi-structured interviews with 12 L&D industry experts to gather insights. Braun and Clarke's (2006) thematic analysis method was used to analyze the collected data. Additionally, a rigorous coding process was undertaken using Saldana\u2019s (2009) coding methods. Initial codes were generated to pinpoint significant elements within the interviews that could reveal insights into the influence, implications and challenges of integrating generative artificial intelligence (AI) into organizational L&D. Findings: The study reveals that the influence and implications of integrating ChatGPT include attaining more efficient and effective L&D programs, boosting employee performance and enhancing their engagement and satisfaction. However, overreliance on ChatGPT can negatively influence organizational knowledge sharing and team dynamics. This study also found that to successfully integrate ChatGPT, organizations should address human-related challenges (i.e. upskilling employees with artificial intelligence skills) and technology-related challenges (i.e. data privacy violations, misinformation and ChatGPT misuse by employees). Originality/value: This research contributes to the existing literature by providing a comprehensive analysis of the multifaceted impact of generative AI on organizational L&D. It provides managers with advice on how to manage the integration of ChatGPT in a way that minimizes potential negative effects while maximizing opportunities. This study is also significant as it provides foundational insights into the capabilities of ChatGPT in organizational L&D, stressing both its transformative potential and the need for careful management to prevent misuse. \u00a9 2025, Emerald Publishing Limited.",

This can allow the systems to deliver actionable insights to support managerial decisions. Thus, people analytics can become a mediator between managers and employees, challenging and redefining their dynamics, relationships, and communication. In this study, we conduct an online experiment where participants take the role of employees, performing a real-effort task. In manipulated scenarios, rewards for completing the task are distributed either by a team leader without algorithmic support, a team leader with the option of algorithmic support, or a team leader who delegates the process of rewarding employees to an autonomous system. Our results indicate that the involvement of people analytics has downstream consequences, inducing feelings of unfairness and betrayal, which ultimately increase demands for reparation and general retaliatory behaviour against the manager and the organisation. Specifically, our findings show that, in unfair situations, employees perceive a stronger violation of fairness when they suspect a people analytics system to be involved in the decision-making process, and less violation when the same unfair decision was made by a manager without algorithmic support. Managers should therefore ensure that, even though they increasingly interact with technical systems, they keep people in focus. \u00a9 2025 The Operational Research Society.",

The main rationale behind the adoption of AI-enabled decision-making is multifaceted, including economizing on time and costs, mitigating risks, increasing effectiveness, and amplifying decision-making confidence. However, relying exclusively on algorithmic decision-making engenders the prospect of discrimination and inequity. This dichotomy between the enthusiasm surrounding the efficiency of AI decision-making and the apprehensions regarding potential discrimination and inequity presents an intricate challenge. The aim of the chapter therefore is to increase awareness regarding AI\u2019s potential proclivity towards biases and discrimination but also elucidate strategies whereby practitioners and scholars specializing in EDI can contribute to the confrontation of challenges that are inherently associated with AI in HRM and the amelioration of workplace environments. \u00a9 The Editors and Contributing Authors Severally 2025.",

    "abstract": "With the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) based systems, a new era has begun. Decisions that were once made by humans are now increasingly being made by these advanced systems, with the inevitable consequence of our growing reliance on AI in many aspects of our lives. At the same time, the opaque nature of AI-based systems and the possibility of unintentional or hidden discriminatory practices and biases raises profound questions not only about the mechanics of AI, but also about how users perceive the fairness of these systems. We hypothesize that providing various explanations for AI decision-making processes and output may enhance users\u2019 fairness perceptions and make them trust the system and adopt its decisions. Hence, we devised an online between-subject experiment that explores users\u2019 fairness and comprehension perceptions of AI systems with respect to the explanations provided by the system, employing a case study of a managerial decision in the human resources (HR) domain. We manipulated (i) the decision-maker (AI or human); (ii) the input (candidate characteristics); (iii) the output (recommendation valence), and (iv) the explanation style. We examined the effect of the various manipulations (and individuals\u2019 demographic and personality characteristics) using multivariate ordinal regression. We also performed a multi-level analysis of experiment components to examine the effects of the decision-maker type, explanation style, and their combination. The results suggest three main conclusions. The first conclusion is that there is a gap in users\u2019 fairness and comprehension perception of AI-based decision making systems compared to human decision making. The second conclusion is that knowing that an AI-based system provided the decisions negatively affects users\u2019 fairness and comprehension perceptions, compared to knowing that humans made the decision. Finally, the third conclusion is that providing case-based, certification-based, or sensitivity-based explanations can narrow this gap and may even eliminate it. Additionally, we found that users\u2019 fairness and comprehension perceptions are influenced by a variety of factors such as the input, output, and explanation provided by the system, as well as by individuals\u2019 age, education, computer skills, and personality. Our findings may help to understand when and how to use explanations to improve users\u2019 perceptions regarding AI-based decision-making.

However, its integration into Human Resource Management (HRM) poses challenges, particularly in recruitment, where AI influences work dynamics and decision-making. This study, using a grounded theory approach, interviewed 39 HR professionals and AI developers to explore potential biases in AI-Recruitment Systems (AIRS) and identify mitigation techniques. Findings highlight a critical gap: the HR profession\u2019s need to embrace both technical skills and nuanced people-focused competencies to collaborate effectively with AI developers and drive informed discussions on the scope of AI\u2019s role in recruitment and selection. This research integrates Gibson\u2019s direct perception theory and Gregory\u2019s indirect perception theory, combining psychological, information systems, and HRM perspectives to offer insights into decision-making biases in AI. A framework is proposed to clarify decision-making biases and guide the development of robust protocols for AI in HR, with a focus on ethical oversight and regulatory needs. This research contributes to AI-based HR decision-making literature by exploring the intersection of cognitive bias and AI-augmented decisions in recruitment and selection. It offers practical insights for HR professionals and AI developers on how collaboration and perception can improve the fairness and effectiveness of AIRS-aided decisions. \u00a9 2025 The Author(s).

    "abstract": "This study examines the current landscape and challenges in the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in recruitment and hiring processes, identifying a crucial gap in comprehensive understanding of AI\u2019s impact on gender dynamics within organizational practices. Despite the growing integration of AI tools, aimed at enhancing fairness and efficiency in recruitment, there is a conspicuous lack of in-depth analysis on the potential biases these technologies might perpetuate. The research addresses the primary question: How does the application of AI in recruitment processes impact gender equality and bias mitigation? Our central argument posits that while AI has the potential to reduce traditional biases associated with human decision-making, its effectiveness heavily depends on the data quality and the ethical frameworks employed during implementation. Utilizing a mixed-methods approach, including a survey among 168 HR professionals across various Italian companies, the study identifies key trends and discrepancies in perceptions versus real outcomes of AI applications in recruitment. Findings reveal that 73.81% of respondents perceive a positive impact of AI on the recruitment process, but only 48.21% believe these technologies significantly improve process efficiency. Concerns remain prevalent, with 81.54% of participants expressing apprehension about AI\u2019s ability to effectively incorporate essential human insights such as empathy. Additionally, the research highlights a crucial statistic where 92.26% of respondents advocate for maintaining human involvement in decision-making processes to mitigate potential biases effectively. This study advances the discourse on AI in recruitment by delineating the technical and ethical considerations crucial for harnessing AI as a tool for inclusion and equity in the workplace. \u00a9 The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.",

However, concerns have been raised throughout society that ML assessments may be biased and perpetuate or exacerbate inequality. Although organizational researchers have begun investigatingMLassessments from traditional psychometric and legal perspectives, there is a need to understand, clarify, and integrate fairness operationalizations and algorithmic bias mitigation methods from the computer science, data science, and organizational research literature. We present a four-stage model of developing ML assessments and applying bias mitigation methods, including (a) generating the training data, (b) training the model, (c) testing the model, and (d) deploying the model. When introducing the four-stage model, we describe potential sources of bias and unfairness at each stage. Then, we systematically review definitions and operationalizations of algorithmic bias, legal requirements governing personnel selection from the United States and Europe, and research on algorithmic bias mitigation across multiple domains and integrate these findings into our framework. Our review provides insights for both research and practice by elucidating possible mechanisms of algorithmic bias while identifying which bias mitigation methods are legal and effective. This integrative framework also reveals gaps in the knowledge of algorithmic bias mitigation that should be addressed by future collaborative research between organizational researchers, computer scientists, and data scientists. We provide recommendations for developing and deploying ML assessments, as well as recommendations for future research into algorithmic bias and fairness. \u00a9 2024 The Author(s)",

    "abstract": "This paper critically examines persistent inequities in existing computing faculty hiring and retention practices, which gravely impact computing educators from marginalized groups. Throughout these processes, applicants fight against multiple systemic barriers, including but not limited to, biased job ads and discriminatory interview practices. The increasing use of generative AI tools to aid in tasks connected to the hiring process, such as writing recommendation letters, exacerbates these biases. The inequities persist despite global initiatives and legal mandates and serve as a direct contradiction to widespread institutional commitments to diversity and inclusion. By building on literature and the lived experiences of the SIGCSE community represented in a recent Technical Symposium session, we raise concerns about the different stages of this process, highlighting the importance of clear expectations and adequate support. The paper concludes with a call to align hiring practices with inclusive institutional values, requiring the academic community to reflect on and revise hiring policies for a more equitable future. It is of paramount importance to address the role of these practices in the erosion of marginalized communities from the computing education community, a marginalization that occurs in many different contexts and negatively impacts everyone involved. \u00a9 2024 Owner/Author.",

The goal of HR analytics is to increase employee engagement, retention rates, performance management, and hiring procedures by using data analysis methods and technologies to better understand workforce trends and patterns. Recent developments in HR analytics highlight the value of predictive analysis for workforce planning and management, including AI and ML, for decision-making while also placing a strong emphasis on data protection, security, and ethics. Among the many functions that HR analytics may play in people management is improving the hiring procedure. By examining important characteristics like education level or job experience, data-driven insights can assist in selecting potential candidates who are most likely to succeed inside the organization. Given that it enables companies to foresee future staffing demands based on current market conditions or demographic shifts, recent trends indicate that predictive analysis will continue to play a crucial role in workforce planning and management.

Assessments range from standardized tests used in admissions, employee selection, licensure examinations, and domestic and international large-scale assessments of cognitive and behavioral skills to formative K\u201312 classroom curricular assessments. The various types of assessments are used for a wide variety of purposes, but they also have many common elements, such as standards for their reliability, validity, and fairness\u2014even classroom assessments have standards. We believe the future of assessment will involve a shift in emphasis on what skills will be measured, innovations in how we go about measuring them, the use of advanced technologies for test operations, and an expansion in the value and kinds of information that test takers will receive from taking the assessment. In this paper, we argue and provide evidence for our belief that the future of assessment contains challenges but is promising. The challenges include risks associated with security and exposure of personal data, test score bias, and inappropriate test uses, all of which may be exacerbated by the growing infiltration of artificial intelligence (AI) into our lives. The promise is increasing opportunities for testing to help individuals achieve their education and career goals and contribute to well-being and overall quality of life. To help achieve this promise we focus on the evidence-based science of measurement in education and workplace learning, a theme throughout this paper. \u00a9 2024 Educational Testing Service.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the impact of generative AI tools on human resource management practices, organizational commitment, employee engagement, and employee performance. The authors also investigated the mediating role of trust in the relationship between user perception and organizational commitment. A structured questionnaire was used to collect the data from the information technology industry employees to measure the 9 reflective constructs optimism, innovativeness, ease of use, usefulness, trust, organizational commitment, vigor, dedication, and employee performance. Two constructs, ease of use and usefulness, are modeled as a higher-order construct \u2013 User Perception, whereas vigor and Dedication are modeled as another higher-order construct, Employee Engagement. The mode-fit indices were assessed for both the higher- and lower-order constructs, and the model-fit indices for both the models, higher- and lower-order constructs reveal an excellent model fit. Positive and statistically significant impacts were observed between the study constructs. The impact of organizational commitment on employee engagement was positive and statistically significant, and in turn, the impact of employee engagement on employee performance was also positive and statistically significant. Trust partially mediated the relationship between user perception and organizational commitment, fostering enhanced employee engagement and performance. The theories of technology readiness, stimulus-organization-response, and technology acceptance model were utilized in the development of the study\u2019s theoretical framework, which provided fresh perspectives on how employee engagement, organizational commitment, and performance are influenced by user experience and trust in the context of generative AI. Theoretically, it opens up new applications such as personalized education and services, digital art, and realistic virtual assistants that were previously unfeasible or impractical for automation. The practical implications are that the field of interdisciplinary research as well as the information technology industry will be greatly impacted by generative AI. To facilitate swift adoption, the principles of generative AI are conceptualized from model-, system-, and application-level perspectives in addition to a social-technical perspective, where they are explicated and defined. In the end, our research has given future scholars a significant research agenda that will enable them to study generative AI from different theoretical perspectives while incorporating the concepts from these theories. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2024.",

We found the biased autosuggestions affected the hiring preference, contingent on stereotypical beliefs of the respective groups: When the group was perceived less warm (e.g., females less warm than males), the biased autosuggestions increased users\u2019 hiring discrimination against the group. In contrast, when the group was perceived warmer (e.g., immigrants warmer than non-immigrant citizens), the biased autosuggestions triggered a reactance response, reducing their hiring discrimination. \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd",

    "abstract": "Gig platforms increasingly harness AI algorithms to manage workers, offering notable efficiency and scalability benefits. However, the rise of worker resistance, such as manipulating algorithms with fake data, poses challenges to these benefits. These algorithms are often perceived as ''black boxes'', leading to issues around transparency. This research thus explores the impact of algorithmic transparency on worker resistance. Using a longitudinal design, we uncovered a paradox: Initially, greater transparency correlates with enhanced fairness perception and reduced resistance. However, beyond a certain threshold, further transparency starts to backfire, leading to decreased fairness perception and amplified resistance. This paradox challenges the prevailing notion that more transparency always leads to positive outcomes. Moreover, we examined the role of human managers, showing that their empathetic support and caring can mitigate worker resistance when transparency fails to foster fairness. This highlights the power of human touch in the algorithm-driven workplace. Overall, these insights suggest a hybrid management model, wherein the cold efficiency of algorithmic managers is complemented by the warm empathy of human managers, offering a blueprint for more productive and harmonious human-machine interactions in the gig economy. \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd",

    "abstract": "This study offers a nuanced exploration into the intersection of expertise and AI-powered decision-making, particularly within the realm of high-volume recruitment. It leverages theory from the evolving discourse on relational expertise and human-AI interaction to examine how experts navigate, interpret, and sometimes challenge AI tool outputs. Through in-depth interviews with 42 recruitment experts, the study focuses on the concept of algorithmic folk theories\u2014the interpretive frameworks through which experts engage with algorithmic recommendations. Central to the study's findings is the range of perceptions among experts toward AI technologies, viewed through the lens of expert-AI pairings. These perceptions oscillate between viewing AI as either a complementary ally or a challenging rival, significantly shaped by organizational contexts. Factors influencing these views include oversight levels, trust in AI outputs, and the prioritization of AI tools in decision-making processes. Findings also reveal instances of algoactivism, where experts actively resist or workaround AI outputs to align with their professional judgment. In turn, algorithmic folk theories are interpretive frameworks informed by and situated within organizational structures. Theoretically, this study deepens our understanding of the relational dynamics between human expertise and AI systems in professional settings. It highlights the critical role of context-specific factors in shaping these interactions and offers new perspectives on the complexities of AI integration for workplace decision-making. I explain my work's findings in relation to our broader discourse around artificial intelligence use at work. Finally, I offer theoretical and practical considerations for future research and practice. \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd",

The study shows that the intention to use technology is influenced by their perceptions of its usefulness and ease of use. By extending TAM to include human-centered considerations, this research aimed to capture the diverse factors that significantly influence users\u2019 acceptance of chatbots in the recruitment process. A three-phase study has been carried out, each serving a distinct purpose. (a) Phase 1 focuses on defining primary themes through qualitative interviews with 10 participants, laying the foundation for subsequent research. (b)Building upon this foundation, Phase 2 engages 28 participants in a refined exploration of these themes, ending in a comprehensive landscape of user perspectives. (c) Finally, Phase 3 employs rigorous Structural Equation Modeling for theoretical framework examination, yielding critical constructs and hypotheses. Moreover, Phase 3 encompasses the thorough development of measurement instruments and extensive data collection, involving 146 participants through questionnaires, the study found that the acceptance of recruitment chatbots is significantly enhanced when these systems are designed to be transparent, provide personalized interactions, efficiently fulfill user needs, and address ethical concerns. These findings contribute to the broader understanding of technology acceptance in the context of recruitment, offering valuable insights for developers and designers to create chatbots that are not only technically advanced but also ethically sound, user-friendly, and effectively aligned with human needs and expectations in recruitment settings. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2024.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: This study aims to develop a conceptual model of positive employee experience using sentiment analysis within algorithm-based human resource (HR) strategies. Its goal is to enhance HR professionals\u2019 understanding of employee experiences and enable data-driven decision-making to create a positive work environment, thereby contributing to the originality of HR research. Design/methodology/approach: The study conducts sentiment analysis \u2013 a text mining technique \u2013 to assess employee reviews and extract distinct positive experience factors. The employed data-driven methodology serves to fortify the reliability and objectivity of the analysis, ultimately resulting in a more refined depiction of the conveyed sentiment. Findings: Utilizing sentiment analysis, the authors identified 135 keywords that signify positive employee experiences. These keywords were then categorized into four clusters aligned with factors influencing employee experience: work, relationships, organizational system and organizational culture, employing an inductive approach. The framework outlines the process of nurturing positive employee experiences throughout the employee life cycle, incorporating insights from the affective events theory and cognitive appraisal theory. Practical implications: Data-driven insights empower HR professionals to enhance employee satisfaction, engagement and productivity. HR managers implementing AI-assisted HR ecosystems need digital and data science skills. Additionally, these insights can offer practical support in accentuating diversity and ethical considerations within the organizational culture. Candid employee data can enhance leadership and support diversity in organizational culture. Managers play a crucial communication role, ensuring flexible access to personalized HR solutions. Originality/value: Applying sentiment analysis through opinion mining allows for the collection of unstructured data, reflecting authentic employee perceptions. This innovative approach expedites issue identification and targeted actions, enhancing employee satisfaction. Textual reviews, integral to employee feedback, offer comprehensive insights. Additionally, considering subjectivity and review length in online employee reviews adds value to understanding experiences (Zhao et\u00a0al., 2019). This study surpasses prior research by directly identifying key factors of employee experience through the analysis of actual employee review texts, addressing a gap in understanding beyond previous attempts. \u00a9 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed the field of hiring, enabling employers to collect and analyse massive amounts of data to understand and predict the suitability of candidates. However, AI can also have subconscious effects on candidates' and employers needs through biased data, which can stem from human biases, algorithmic errors or external factors. For example, Amazon scrapped an AI-based recruitment programme that favoured male candidates over female candidates due to the historical patterns in the resumes it analysed. This paper examines how AI can shape candidate's needs through biased data from various sources and types, and what are the consequences for candidate's welfare and rights. We review the literature on AI applications in hiring, the origins and kinds of bias in AI systems, and the potential risks and benefits for candidates. We also suggest some guidelines for reducing bias in AI and enabling candidates to make informed and ethical choices online. We argue that AI can be a double-edged sword for candidate's needs and that more research and regulation are required to ensure its fair and accountable use. \u00a9 2025 Osama Akram Amin Metwally Hussien, Krison Hasanaj, Anil Kaya, Hamid Jahankhani and Sara El-Deeb.",

    "abstract": "Emotion AI is increasingly used to automatically evaluate asynchronous hiring interviews. Although touted for increasing hiring fit and reducing bias, it is unclear how job-seekers perceive emotion AI-enabled asynchronous interviews. This gap is striking, given job-seekers' marginalized position in hiring and how job-seekers with marginalized identities may be particularly vulnerable to this technology's potential harms. Addressing this gap, we conducted exploratory interviews with 14 U.S.-based participants with direct, recent experience with emotion AI-enabled asynchronous interviews. While participants acknowledged the asynchronous, virtual modality's potential benefits to employers and job-seekers, they perceived harms to job-seekers associated with automatic emotion inferences that our analysis maps to distributive, procedural, and interactional injustices. We find that social identity can inform job-seekers' perceptions of emotion AI, extending prior work's understandings of the factors contributing to job-seekers' perceptions of AI (broadly) in hiring. Moreover, our results suggest that emotion AI use may reconfigure demands for emotional labor in hiring and that deploying this technology in its current state may unjustly risk harmful outcomes for job-seekers - or, at the very least, perceptions thereof, which shape behaviors and attitudes. Accordingly, we recommend against the present adoption of emotion AI in hiring, identifying opportunities for the design of future asynchronous hiring interview platforms to be meaningfully transparent, contestable, and privacy-preserving. We emphasize that only a subset of perceived harms we surface may be alleviated by these efforts; some injustices may only be resolved by removing emotion AI-enabled features. \u00a9 2024 ACM.",

    "abstract": "Our work aims to mitigate gender bias within word embeddings and investigates the effects of these adjustments on enhancing fairness in resume job-matching problems. By conducting a case study on resume data, we explore the prevalence of gender bias in job categorization\u2014a significant barrier to equal career opportunities, particularly in the context of machine learning applications. This study scrutinizes how biased representations in job assignments, influenced by a variety of factors such as skills and resume descriptors within diverse semantic frameworks, affect the classification process. The investigation extends to the nuanced language of resumes and the presence of subtle gender biases, including the employment of gender-associated terms, and examines how these terms\u2019 vector representations can skew fairness, leading to a disproportionate mapping of resumes to job categories based on gender. Our findings reveal a significant correlation between gender discrepancies in classification true positive rate and gender imbalances across professions that potentially deepen these disparities. The goal of this study is to (1) mitigate bias at the level of word embeddings via a debiasing-assisted deep generative modeling approach, thereby fostering more equitable and gender-fair vector representations; (2) evaluate the resultant impact on the fairness of job classification; (3) explore the implementation of a gender-weighted sampling technique to achieve a more balanced representation of genders across various job categories when such an imbalance exists. This approach involves modifying the data distribution according to gender before it is input into the classifier model, aiming to ensure equal opportunity and promote gender fairness in occupational classifications.

    "abstract": "A new era of digital transformation has begun with the rapid integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology with human management, changing traditional methods to people management. Due to the unprecedented digital transitions that businesses are seeing, AI integration in Human resource management (HRM) has become a significant area of focus. This systematic literature critically examines how AI is altering the landscape of its impact on employee performance in the HRM area in the era of digital transformation. The Scopus database, where 73 peer-reviewed articles are found These are subjected to integrated methodology of Bibliometric analysis, Content analysis, Epistemological analysis and Substantive analysis to identify the emerging themes, trends and contribution of theory in the AI impact on the employee performance in digital transformation era. The results identifies the major themes a) Digital Transformation in HRM for enhancing Efficiency b) Deep learning and neural networks in HRM c) Innovation and Technology adoption in HRM and d) Human resource investments. From the epistemological analysis results \u201cResource Based theory,\u201d has been mentioned highest (4 times) and shows how HRM is evolving in the context of digital change. With 3 instances each, institutional theory with empirical study is being the most common method. Substantive analysis shows the Digital Transformation, Employee Performance, Work life balance, and Organisational change are the significant criteria, whereas sub-criteria included Innovation, performance management, and Techno stress. Additionally, it investigates the challenges and opportunities arising from how AI is incorporated into HRM procedures and its implications for workforce dynamics. The study has proposed a model of 3 major criteria and 14 sub criteria for future research actions based on substantive analysis. AI integration in HRM requires strategic planning, ethical considerations, and employee well-being. Organisations that recognise these consequences and handle issues will be more prepared for AI-driven HRM. \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Inc.",

We then investigate how the consideration focus of personnel attributes mediates the impact of roles on trust through thought-listing (Study 1), mediation-by-moderation (Studies 2a & 2b), and self-reported measures (Study 3). To mitigate this misalignment, we examine the AI\u2013human assemblage design and offer an optimal way to bridge the trust divide (Study 4).

We hypothesized that creating letters of recommendation for both female and male candidates for academic promotion in surgery using an AI platform, ChatGPT, would elucidate the entrained gender biases already present in the promotion process. DESIGN: Using ChatGPT, we generated 6 letters of recommendation for \u201ca phenomenal surgeon applying for job promotion to associate professor position\u201d, specifying \u201cfemale\u201d or \u201cmale\u201d before surgeon in the prompt. We compared 3 \u201cfemale\u201d letters to 3 \u201cmale\u201d letters for differences in length, language, and tone. RESULTS: The letters written for females averaged 298 words compared to 314 for males. Female letters more frequently referred to \u201ccompassion\u201d, \u201cempathy\u201d, and \u201cinclusivity\u201d; whereas male letters referred to \u201crespect\u201d, \u201creputation\u201d, and \u201cskill\u201d. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the gender bias present in promotion letters generated by ChatGPT, reiterating existing literature regarding real letters of recommendation in academic surgery.

However, organisations often fail to realise these potentials because of a limited understanding of why individuals choose to adopt or disregard respective tools. Prior research on innovation adoption offers preliminary insights but fails to aggregate the determinants of individual adoption into actionable suggestions for decisions in the ML adoption process. Our study applies focused interviews to examine non-ML experts' reasoning for using a specific tool tailored to a public sector organisation, which corresponds to the usual end-user perspective of ML-based HRA adoption. By drawing from the HRA adoption framework, provided by Vargas et al. (2018), we contribute to the literature by identifying relevant beliefs and experiences influencing one's intention to adopt ML-based HRA and by qualitatively linking these beliefs to ML characteristics such as transparency, automation and fairness. For practitioners, we provide actionable guidance emphasising the need to ensure fairness proactively, as interviewees do not consider this aspect when deciding to adopt ML-based HRA. \u00a9 2024 The Authors",

However, ASR can be less accurate for (i.e., biased against) certain demographic subgroups. This is concerning, given that the machine-learning (ML) models used to automatically score video interviews use ASR transcriptions of interviewee responses as inputs. To address these concerns, we investigate the extent of ASR bias and its effects in automatically scored interviews. Specifically, we compare the accuracy of ASR transcription for English as a second language (ESL) versus non-ESL interviewees, people of color (and Black interviewees separately) versus White interviewees, and male versus female interviewees. Then, we test whether ASR bias causes bias in ML model scores\u2014both in terms of differential convergent correlations (i.e., subgroup differences in correlations between observed and ML scores) and differential means (i.e., shifts in subgroup differences from observed to ML scores). To do so, we apply one human and four ASR transcription methods to two samples of mock video interviews (Ns = 1,014 and 414), and then we train and test models using these different transcripts to score multiple constructs. We observed significant bias in the commercial ASR services across nearly all comparisons, with the magnitude of bias differing across the ASR services.

We discuss what these results mean for the nature of bias, fairness, and validity of ML models for scoring verbal open-ended responses. \u00a9 (2025), Journal of Applied Psychology",

    "abstract": "Rank fusion is a technique for combining multiple rankings into a single aggregated ranking, commonly used in high-stakes applications. For hiring decisions, a fused ranking might combine evaluations of different candidates from various job boards into one list. Ideally, such fused rankings are fair. Meaning they do not withhold opportunities or resources from marginalized groups of candidates, even if such biases may be present in the to-be-fused rankings. Prior work fairly aggregating rankings is limited to ensuring proportional (not addressing equality) fairness when combining ranked lists containing the same candidate items. Yet, real-world fusion tasks often combine rankings of varying candidate sets, may also contain relevance scores, or are better suited to equal representation. To address fairness in these settings, we present a new plug-and-play fairness-aware fusion strategy: WISE fusion. WISE works in fusion settings where we have closed-box access to a score-powered rank fusion (SRF) method, making it possible to fairness-enhance existing fusion pipelines with little added cost. WISE uses existing evaluations of candidates from an as-is SRF method to achieve proportional or equal rank fairness in the final fused ranking. Our experimental study demonstrates that WISE beats the fairness and utility performance of state-of-the-art methods applied to these new fair rank fusion settings. \u00a9 2024 ACM.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates the factors influencing the aversion of Swiss HRM departments to algorithmic decision-making in the hiring process. Based on a survey provided to 324 private and public HR professionals, it explores how privacy concerns, general attitude toward AI, perceived threat, personal development concerns, and personal well-being concerns, as well as control variables such as gender, age, time with organization, and hierarchical position, influence their algorithmic aversion. Its aim is to understand the algorithmic aversion of HR employees in the private and public sectors. The following article is based on three PLS-SEM structural equation models. Its main findings are that privacy concerns are generally important in explaining aversion to algorithmic decision-making in the hiring process, especially in the private sector. Positive and negative general attitudes toward AI are also very important, especially in the public sector. Perceived threat also has a positive impact on algorithmic aversion among private and public sector respondents. While personal development concerns explain algorithmic aversion in general, they are most important for public actors. Finally, personal well-being concerns explain algorithmic aversion in both the private and public sectors, but more so in the latter, while our control variables were never statistically significant. This said, this article makes a significant contribution to explaining the causes of the aversion of HR departments to recruitment decision-making algorithms. This can enable practitioners to anticipate these various points in order to minimize the reluctance of HR professionals when considering the implementation of this type of tool. \u00a9 2024 by the author.",

Through semi-structured qualitative interviews with 15 migrant workers in the UK, this research identifies key challenges faced by migrant employees amidst the integration of advanced technologies like AI and robotics in HRM systems. Thematic analysis reveals that while Industry 5.0 has the potential to mitigate human biases, it can also perpetuate existing prejudices if not managed effectively. This study highlights two main themes: the experiences of discrimination and challenges in the context of Industry 5.0, and the role of technology in HRM systems. The findings indicate that automated HR systems can both reduce and increase biases, highlighting the importance of inclusive practices and targeted support programs to help migrant workers adapt to a technologically advanced labor market.

    "abstract": "Rapid advances in artificial intelligence (AI), including large language models (LLMs) with abilities that rival those of human experts on a wide array of tasks, are reshaping how people make important decisions. At the same time, critics worry that LLMs may inadvertently discriminate against some groups. To address these concerns, recent regulations call for auditing the LLMs used in important decisions such as hiring. But neither current regulations nor the scientific literature offers clear guidance on how to conduct these audits. In this article, we propose and investigate one approach for auditing algorithms: correspondence experiments, a widely applied tool for detecting bias in human judgments. We applied this method to a range of LLMs instructed to rate job candidates using a novel data set of job applications for K-12 teaching positions in a large American public school district. By altering the application materials to imply that candidates are members of specific demographic groups, we measured the extent to which race and gender influenced the LLMs\u2019 ratings of the candidates\u2019 suitability. We found moderate race and gender disparities, with the models slightly favoring women and non-White candidates. This pattern persisted across several variations in our experiment. It is unclear what might be driving these disparities, but we hypothesize that they stem from posttraining efforts, which are part of the LLM training process and intended to correct biases in these models. We conclude by discussing the limitations of correspondence experiments for auditing algorithms. \u00a9 Behavioral Science and Policy Association 2025.",

    "abstract": "Who should compensate you if you get hit by a car in \u201cautopilot\u201d mode: the safety driver or the car manufacturer? What about if you find out you were unfairly discriminated against by an AI decision-making tool that was being supervised by an HR professional? Should the developer compensate you, the company that procured the software, or the (employer of the) HR professional that was \u201csupervising\u201d the system's output? These questions do not have easy answers. In the European Union and elsewhere around the world, AI governance is turning towards risk regulation. Risk regulation alone is, however, rarely optimal. The situations above all involve the liability for harms that are caused by or with an AI system. While risk regulations like the AI Act regulate some aspects of these human and machine interactions, they do not offer those impacted by AI systems any rights and little avenues to seek redress. From a corrective justice perspective risk regulation must also be complemented by liability law because when harms do occur, harmed individuals should be compensated. From a risk-prevention perspective, risk regulation may still fall short of creating optimal incentives for all parties to take precautions. Because risk regulation is not enough, scholars and regulators around the world have highlighted that AI regulations should be complemented by liability rules to address AI harms when they occur. Using a law and economics framework this Article examines how the recently proposed AI liability regime in the EU \u2013 a revision of the Product Liability Directive, and an AI Liability effectively complement the AI Act and how they address the particularities of AI-human interactions. \u00a9 2024 The Author",

    "abstract": "Higher education institutions in Cameroon have undergone a significant transformation in terms of population size, teaching and administration. Between 2010 and 2023, the State has created five more state universities, in addition to six existing ones, to meet the demands for education. This transformation, which you have been a part of, has had implications for the supply of human resources (both teaching and administrative staff). This could potentially challenge the effective management of human resources, which could impact the quality of education, usually envisaged in students' performance. While other factors can affect the quality of higher education, managing human resources, especially teachers, is crucial for quality assurance. Ensuring that human resources have the required skills to do what is expected of them is vital to sustaining organizational productivity. This calls for a need for automation in managing human resources. From this backdrop, this chapter explores how Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be used in human resource management (HRM) in higher education institutions for quality assurance. It provides an overview of HRM in higher education, AI and HRM, and ethical considerations in using AI in HRM. Specifically, it will delve into how AI can streamline HR processes, such as automating recruitment and onboarding, enhancing decision-making and ultimately improving the quality of education. \u00a9 The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",

Employers use AI to perform many HRM functions-from sourcing to screening candidates, predicting turnover, calculating compensations, and powering workforce analytics. However, HR experts are confronted with the challenge of finding a balance between using AI to gain competitive advantages and preventing the anathema of ethical issues. While AI is an algorithm that mimics human intelligence to function, it is characterized by unintended biases that could escalate discrimination and lack of fairness, loss of privacy, control, among others. It is increasingly becoming incontrovertible that AI is not a silver bullet for HRM but undoubtedly a tool to aid human decision-making for quicker, smarter, and more meaningful outcomes.

    "abstract": "The fast pace of changing technologies, increased adoption of artificial intelligence and the deployment of robots have placed a heavy premium on managing people in the modern work environment. It remains questionable whether using these technologies is as friendly to workers whose fears are amplified with the possibility of being replaced, while the employers see the technologies as a means to reduce cost, exert control, promote efficiency and gain competitive advantage. Thus, a plethora of challenges have been noticed, which include managing employees' work-life balance and well-being, job security and issues of privacy, among others, with their associated psychological implications. Managing people at work has never been more challenging, given the human-like tendencies of AI and robots, as they are considered intelligent, clever and emotionless, but may be characterized by unintended biases. The ongoing debate on whether these technologies can push humans aside (in the foreseeable future) is valid. HR managers must have critical thoughts on resourcing issues, given the disruptive possibilities. The current situation calls for a paradigm shift in human skills required at work, and rewriting job descriptions becomes necessary. Also, HR practitioners are faced with managing employees' engagement and the disruptive changes AI and robots bring. This chapter examines the likelihood of AI and robots seamlessly co-existing with humans at work, with the latter driving human activities while technologies manage the end-to-end process. \u00a9 The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",

The use of cutting-edge technologies in human resources (HR) presents an opportunity to improve efficiency, effectiveness, and competitive advantage. For example, several success stories have been associated with improved efficiency, decision-making, and cost reduction in hiring. However, ethical concerns relating to gender and racial bias, as well as breaches of employees' personal data, have surfaced. Therefore, AI-based decision-making should be predicated on sound, reliable, and defendable ethical business standards. Regardless of digitalisation, HR must remain accountable for practices that fully comply with legislation, such as the Bill of Rights, the Employment Equity Act, and the Protection of Personal Information Act, in the South African context. This chapter provides guidance for HR practitioners concerning ethical issues that necessitate careful consideration when artificial intelligence is deployed within human resources.

However, the impact of AI on HRM is not evenly distributed. Due to a variety of factors, the Global South is lagging behind the Global North in terms of AI adoption, creating a widening disparity in the effectiveness and efficiency of HR operations. This edited book explores HRM, artificial intelligence and the future of work in the Global South. It addresses key elements of how technology is transforming the workplace and people management, including HR automation, robotisation, big data analytics, smart systems, virtualisation, AI, machine learning and the Internet of Things. The chapters offer a collection of cases from various Global South countries, draw on various types of research (empirical, review papers, conceptual and theoretical) andincorporate contextual issues such as technology, politics, culture, ethics and economics. Despite the relatively slow adoption of AI in the Global South compared to developed nations, its potential impact on the future of work remains significant, particularly in shaping the role of HR as a bridge between technology and human resources. This book will be a valuable resource for scholars, students and policymakers interested in the future of work in the Global South, as it brings together critical insights from scholars and practitioners from the region, providing a much-needed perspective on this important issue. \u00a9 The Editor(s)(if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

    "abstract": "This study examines the profound impact of megatrends, encompassing transformative global forces such as demographic shifts and technological advancements, on business operations in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). As the world transitions into a fully digital era, organizations face unprecedented challenges, necessitating adaptations in organizational structures, leadership, and HR models. Failure to align with these megatrends risks organizational obsolescence, particularly in the rapidly evolving Industry 4.0 landscape. The study delves into the disruptions caused by technological advancements, economic shifts, and geopolitical tensions, highlighting the increasing demand for digital competence among employees and the consequent shift in job requirements. It explores how AI-based management approaches and Smart HRM solutions are pivotal for navigating these complexities, enhancing operational efficiency, and addressing workforce challenges. However, ethical considerations and data privacy concerns must be carefully managed. Theoretical implications suggest a paradigm shift in organizational dynamics, emphasizing the need for theoretical models to reflect the transformed nature of work. Practically, businesses are urged to invest in workforce development, leverage technological advancements, and adapt marketing strategies to meet the diverse needs of the UAE's multicultural society. The study fills existing research gaps, providing actionable insights for businesses to thrive amidst megatrends and AI-driven changes. It underscores the dynamic and transformative nature of the UAE's economic landscape, emphasizing the importance of adaptive strategies aligned with national development goals. While limitations exist, foresight, and proactive planning are essential for organizations seeking resilience and sustainable growth in the UAE's evolving business landscape. \u00a9 The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",

The study explores the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to reshape the management of gig economy workers with special reference to human resource management and the challenges faced by such workers. The study has employed an extensive literature review approach. The findings of the study reveal that AI and ML in the hiring and recruiting supports HR by expanding access to opportunities, enhancing personalisation, and mitigating bias and discrimination. AI brings changes in gig workers' performance management by monitoring performance indicators, examination of client input, skill gap identification, performance benchmarking. Furthermore, training platforms driven by AI can assist gig workers in determining the skills they need to acquire and in creating individualized learning plans. The novelty of the study stems from exploring the role of AI training and performance management, which is yet unexplored. \u00a9 2024 by IGI Global. All rights reserved.",

    "abstract": "Intelligent software systems (e.g., conversational agents, profiling systems, recruitment systems) are often designed in a manner which may perpetuate anti-Black racism and other forms of socio-cultural discrimination. This may reinforce social inequities by supporting the automation of consequential and sometimes unfair decisions that may be made by such systems and which may have an adverse impact on credit scores, insurance payouts, and even health evaluations, just to name a few. My lightning talk will therefore emphasize the need to propose a new type of nonfunctional requirements called ECI (emotional and cultural intelligence) requirements that will aim at developing discrimination-aware intelligent software systems. Such systems will notably be able to behave empathetically toward everyone, including minoritized groups and will ensure these groups are treated fairly. My talk will also emphasize the need to develop novel system assurance solutions to assure these ECI requirements are sufficiently supported by intelligent software systems. \u00a9 2024 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

In the findings, they aim to describe the gender bias in professional functions in businesses. On the other hand, they hope to gain insight into potential gender discrepancies between operational and leadership positions, as well as between departments. The findings of this chapter will benefit researchers, academics, and managers in analyzing gender-related practices and policies. Organizations can become more aware of their gendered practices, which affect the recruitment procedure and the varied roles and responsibilities assigned to men and women, by giving voice to the prejudices that generate gender biases.

    "abstract": "The k-secretary problem deals with online selection of at most k numerically scored applicants, where selection decisions are immediate upon their arrival and irrevocable, with the goal of maximizing total score. There is, however, wide prevalence of bias in evaluations of applicants from different demographic groups (e.g., gender, age, race), and the assumption of an algorithm observing their true score is unreasonable in practice. In this work, we propose the poset secretary problem, where selection decisions must be made by observing a partial order over the applicants. This partial order is constructed to account for uncertainty and biases in applicant scores. We assume that each applicant has a fixed score, which is not visible to the algorithm and is consistent with the partial order. Using a random partitioning technique from the matroid secretary literature, we provide order-optimal competitive algorithms for the poset secretary problem and provide matching lower bounds. Further, we develop the theory of thresholding in posets to provide a tight, adaptive-thresholding algorithm under regimes where k grows quickly enough, thus matching the adaptiveness to k shown for the classical k-secretary problem. We then study a special case, in which applicants belong to g disjoint demographic groups and the bias is group specific. We provide competitive algorithms for adversarial and stochastic variants of this special case, including a framework, Gap, for parallelizing any vanilla k-secretary algorithm to the group setting. Finally, we perform a case study on real-world data to demonstrate the responsiveness of our algorithms to data and their impact on selection rates. \u00a9 2023 INFORMS.",

Drawing on social exchange theory and leader-member exchange theory, we identify factors that contribute to initial trust in AI through cognitive and affective processing from the perspective of employees in the Chinese context. An online survey (N = 426) was conducted with a 2 (explanation of AI: without vs with) \u00d7 2 (trust in leaders: low vs high) design. Our findings demonstrate that initial trust plays a crucial role in AI adoption, and a trustworthy leader increases employees' AI trust and intention to adopt. Providing AI's benefits and risks moderates initial trust and the pathway to adoption. Moreover, familiarity with AI's application in HRM and organizational collectivism is also beneficial. Our findings suggest that organizations should prioritize cultivating initial trust in AI with employee-oriented strategies, including trusted leadership and supportive training resources. \u00a9 2024 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.",

    "abstract": "The ever-increasing adoption of AI technologies in the hiring landscape to enhance human resources efficiency raises questions about algorithmic decision-making's implications in employment, especially for job applicants, including those at higher risk of social discrimination. Among other concepts, such as transparency and accountability, fairness has become crucial in AI recruitment debates due to the potential reproduction of bias and discrimination that can disproportionately affect certain vulnerable groups. However, the ideals and ambitions of fairness may signify different meanings to various stakeholders. Conceptualizing fairness is critical because it may provide a clear benchmark for evaluating and mitigating biases, ensuring that AI systems do not perpetuate existing imbalances and promote, in this case, equitable opportunities for all candidates in the job market. To this end, in this article, we conduct a scoping literature review on fairness in AI applications for recruitment and selection purposes, with special emphasis on its definition, categorization, and practical implementation. We start by explaining how AI applications have been increasingly used in the hiring process, especially to increase the efficiency of the HR team. We then move to the limitations of this technological innovation, which is known to be at high risk of privacy violations and social discrimination. Against this backdrop, we focus on defining and operationalizing fairness in AI applications for recruitment and selection purposes through cross-disciplinary lenses. Although the applicable legal frameworks and some research currently address the issue piecemeal, we observe and welcome the emergence of some cross-disciplinary efforts aimed at tackling this multifaceted challenge. We conclude the article with some brief recommendations to guide and shape future research and action on the fairness of AI applications in the hiring process for the better. \u00a9 2024",

    "abstract": "The primary goal of this research is to investigate candidate attitudes toward artificial intelligence (AI)-supported chatbots as an alternative to traditional recruitment interviews, aiming to understand the potential impact of AI-assisted processes on the employee selection landscape. To systematically evaluate various factors and their relative importance in shaping candidate preferences, this study employed the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) as a decision-making tool. The AHP approach facilitated the analysis of findings based on the sum of rankings assigned by evaluators to determine the relative significance of different factors. Additionally, a pairwise comparison questionnaire was utilized to assess the application of AI interview methodology within the research framework. This ensured a comprehensive understanding of its potential advantages and drawbacks. By comparing candidates' interview experiences across four main categories\u2014performance anxiety, environmental compliance, self-trust, and comfort level\u2014the study results reveal that AI-assisted interviews offer a more advantageous experience for candidates. This suggests that AI technology can play a significant role in enhancing the recruitment process. The research highlights ease of use and suitability for job interviews as critical factors influencing companies' adoption of AI interview technology. Furthermore, it sheds light on the aspects that organizations need to consider when evaluating and implementing AI-driven solutions in their recruitment strategies. \u00a9 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",

    "abstract": "Despite frequent claims that increased use of artificial intelligence (AI) in hiring will reduce the human bias that has long plagued recruitment and selection, AI may equally replicate and amplify such bias and embed it in technology. This article explores exclusion and inclusion in AI-supported hiring, focusing on three interrelated areas: data, design and decisions. It is suggested that in terms of data, organisational fit, categorisations and intersectionality require consideration in relation to exclusion. As various stakeholders collaborate to create AI, it is essential to explore which groups are dominant and how subjective assessments are encoded in technology. Although AI-supported hiring should enhance recruitment decisions, evidence is lacking on how humans and machines interact in decision-making, and how algorithms can be audited and regulated effectively for inclusion. This article recommends areas for interrogation through further research, and contributes to understanding how algorithmic inclusion can be achieved in AI-supported hiring. \u00a9 2023 The Authors.

We present a multidisciplinary perspective on digital transformation and D&I that demonstrates that, in the context of automated decision making, where algorithmic biases and the standardisation of thought represent new risks, neurodiversity initiatives become a cornerstone for advancing D&I. Based on interviews with neurodiversity experts, we identify innovative ways to efficiently configure an inclusive organisational design targeting neurodiversity by leveraging technologies. We identify several properties of technologies that support D&I in neurodiversity initiatives: the neutralisation of biases during interviews, the development of digital support for physical and mental well-being and the facilitation of different cognition modes. Finally, we critically discuss the risks and opportunities offered by various technologies in terms of performance evaluation, new forms of dominance, and design of a digital ecosystem for mental well-being. \u00a9 2023 The Authors.

After reviewing the evolution of productivity management in academia, it argues that surveillance via APM shifts expectations not just about effectiveness at work but also about how work, and the good worker, come to be defined. In our paradigmatic case study of Office 365, we specify how the automated surveillance of workforce practices are deployed to redefine productivity in higher education: productive workers become good data subjects as well as producers of papers, grants, and other traditional outputs of success. Our analysis suggests performing well at work is managed in and by the platform via logics of the surveillance of wellness, time-regulation, and social connectivity to influence, manage, and control workers. We critique these automated performance measures in terms of platform capitalism, noting Office 365\u2019s Viva Insights function as a telematic device of surveillance. The final section of the paper places these trends in Australia\u2019s socio-legal context by showing how Viva is insufficient for considering performance given the range of practices that constitute \u201cacademic work,\u201d including but not limited to the need for unmonitored activity. Yet, we observe that currently little can be done about Office 365\u2019s surveillant presence given a regulatory regime that by and large excludes productivity surveillance from the scope of regulated surveillance activities. \u00a9 The author(s), 2024|.",

    "abstract": "We present a structural approach toward achieving equal opportunity in systems of algorithmic decision-making called algorithmic pluralism. Algorithmic pluralism describes a state of affairs in which no set of algorithms severely limits access to opportunity, allowing individuals the freedom to pursue a diverse range of life paths. To argue for algorithmic pluralism, we adopt Joseph Fishkin's theory of bottlenecks, which focuses on the structure of decision-points that determine how opportunities are allocated. The theory contends that each decision-point or \"bottleneck'' limits access to opportunities with some degree of severity and legitimacy. We extend Fishkin's structural viewpoint and use it to reframe existing systemic concerns about equal opportunity in algorithmic decision-making, such as patterned inequality and algorithmic monoculture. In proposing algorithmic pluralism, we argue for the urgent priority of alleviating severe bottlenecks in algorithmic-decision-making. We contend that there must be a pluralism of opportunity available to many different individuals in order to promote equal opportunity in a systemic way. We further show how this framework has several implications for system design and regulation through current debates about equal opportunity in algorithmic hiring. \u00a9 2024 Owner/Author.",

In this paper, we explore the alignment between people's perceptions of fairness and two popular fairness metrics designed for rankings. In a crowdsourced experiment with 480 participants, people rated the perceived fairness of a hypothetical scholarship distribution scenario. Results suggest a strong inclination towards relying on explicit score values. There is also evidence of people's preference for one fairness metric, NDKL, over the other metric, ARP. Qualitative results paint a more complex picture: some participants endorse meritocratic award schemes and express concerns about fairness metrics being used to modify rankings; while other participants acknowledge socio-economic factors in score-based rankings as justification for adjusting rankings. In summary, we find that operationalizing algorithmic fairness in practice is a balancing act between mitigating harms towards marginalized groups and societal conventions of leveraging traditional performance scores such as grades in decision-making contexts. \u00a9 2024 ACM.",

    "abstract": "In July 2023, New York City (NYC) implemented the first attempt to create an algorithm auditing regime for commercial machine-learning systems. Local Law 144 (LL 144), requires NYC-based employers using automated employment decision-making tools (AEDTs) in hiring to be subject to annual bias audits by an independent auditor. In this paper, we analyse what lessons can be learned from LL 144 for other national attempts to create algorithm auditing regimes. Using qualitative interviews with 17 experts and practitioners working within the regime, we find LL 144 has failed to create an effective auditing regime: the law fails to clearly define key aspects like AEDTs and what constitutes an independent auditor, leaving auditors, vendors who create AEDTs, and companies using AEDTs to define the law's practical implementation in ways that failed to protect job applicants. Several factors contribute to this: first, the law was premised on a faulty transparency-driven theory of change that fails to stop biased AEDTs from being used by employers. Second, industry lobbying led to the definition of what constitutes an AEDT being narrowed to the point where most companies considered their tools exempt. Third, we find auditors face enormous practical and cultural challenges gaining access to data from employers and vendors building these tools. Fourth, we find wide disagreement over what constitutes a legitimate auditor and identify four different kinds of 'auditor roles' that serve different functions and offer different kinds of services. We conclude with four recommendations for policymakers seeking to create similar bias auditing regimes that use clearer definitions and metrics and more accountability. By exploring LL 144 through the lens of auditors, our paper advances the evidence base around audit as an accountability mechanism, and can provide guidance for policymakers seeking to create similar regimes. \u00a9 2024 Owner/Author.",

    "abstract": "Modern advances in AI have increased employer interest in tracking workers' biometric signals - e.g., their brainwaves and facial expressions - to evaluate and make predictions about their performance and productivity. These technologies afford managers information about internal emotional and physiological states that were previously accessible only to individual workers, raising new concerns around worker privacy and autonomy. Yet, the research literature on the impact of AI-powered biometric work monitoring (AI-BWM) technologies on workers remains fragmented across disciplines and industry sectors, limiting our understanding of its impacts on workers at large. In this paper, we sytematically review 129 papers, spanning varied disciplines and industry sectors, that discuss and analyze the impact of AI-powered biometric monitoring technologies in occupational settings. We situate this literature across a process model that spans the development, deployment, and usage phases of these technologies. We further draw on Shelby et al.'s Taxonomy of Socio-technical Harms in AI systems to systematize the harms experienced by workers across the three phases of our process model. We find that the development, deployment, and sustained use of AI-powered biometric work monitoring technologies put workers at risk of a number of the socio-technical harms specified by Shelby et al.: e.g., by forcing workers to exert additional emotional labor to avoid flagging unreliable affect monitoring systems, or through the use of these data to make inferences about productivity. Our research contributes to the field of critical AI studies by highlighting the potential for a cascade of harms to occur when the impact of these technologies on workers is not considered at all phases of our process model. \u00a9 2024 Owner/Author.",

To address this important concern, we present a resume audit study, in which we ask ChatGPT (specifically, GPT-4) to rank a resume against the same resume enhanced with an additional leadership award, scholarship, panel presentation, and membership that are disability-related. We find that GPT-4 exhibits prejudice towards these enhanced CVs. Further, we show that this prejudice can be quantifiably reduced by training a custom GPTs on principles of DEI and disability justice. Our study also includes a unique qualitative analysis of the types of direct and indirect ableism GPT-4 uses to justify its biased decisions and suggest directions for additional bias mitigation work. Additionally, since these justifications are presumably drawn from training data containing real-world biased statements made by humans, our analysis suggests additional avenues for understanding and addressing human bias. \u00a9 2024 Owner/Author.",

    "abstract": "Automated decision-making systems are increasingly deployed in domains such as hiring and credit approval where negative outcomes can have substantial ramifications for decision subjects. Thus, recent research has focused on providing explanations that help decision subjects understand the decision system and enable them to take actionable recourse to change their outcome. Popular counterfactual explanation techniques aim to achieve this by describing alterations to an instance that would transform a negative outcome to a positive one. Unfortunately, little user evaluation has been performed to assess which of the many counterfactual approaches best achieve this goal. In this work, we conduct a crowd-sourced between-subjects user study (N = 252) to examine the effects of counterfactual explanation type and presentation on lay decision subjects' understandings of automated decision systems. We find that the region-based counterfactual type significantly increases objective understanding, subjective understanding, and response confidence as compared to the point-based type. We also find that counterfactual presentation significantly effects response time and moderates the effect of counterfactual type for response confidence, but not understanding. A qualitative analysis reveals how decision subjects interact with different explanation configurations and highlights unmet needs for explanation justification. Our results provide valuable insights and recommendations for the development of counterfactual explanation techniques towards achieving practical actionable recourse and empowering lay users to seek justice and opportunity in automated decision workflows. \u00a9 2024 ACM.",

    "abstract": "Preference aggregation mechanisms help decision-makers combine diverse preference rankings produced by multiple voters into a single consensus ranking. Prior work has developed methods for aggregating multiple rankings into a fair consensus over the same set of candidates. Yet few real-world problems present themselves as such precisely formulated aggregation tasks with each voter fully ranking all candidates. Instead, preferences are often expressed as rankings over partial and even disjoint subsets of candidates. For instance, hiring committee members typically opt to rank their top choices instead of exhaustively ordering every single job applicant. However, the existing literature does not offer a framework for characterizing nor ensuring group fairness in such partial preference aggregation tasks. Unlike fully ranked settings, partial preferences imply both a selection decision of whom to rank plus an ordering decision of how to rank the selected candidates. Our work fills this gap by conceptualizing the open problem of fair partial preference aggregation. We introduce an impossibility result for fair selection from partial preferences and design a computational framework showing how we can navigate this obstacle. Inspired by Single Transferable Voting, our proposed solution PreFair produces consensus rankings that are fair in the selection of candidates and also in their relative ordering. Our experimental study demonstrates that PreFair achieves the best performance in this dual fairness objective compared to state-of-the-art alternatives adapted to this new problem while still satisfying voter preferences. \u00a9 2024 ACM.",

Local Law 144 (LL 144) requires AEDTs to be independently audited annually for race and gender bias, and the audit report must be publicly posted. Additionally, employers are obligated to post a transparency notice with the job listing. In this study, 155 student investigators recorded 391 employers' compliance with LL 144 and the user experience for prospective job applicants. Among these employers, 18 posted audit reports and 13 posted transparency notices. These rates could potentially be explained by a significant limitation in the accountability mechanisms enacted by LL 144. Since the law grants employers substantial discretion over whether their system is in scope of the law, a null result cannot be said to indicate non-compliance, a condition we call \"null compliance.\"Employer discretion may also explain our finding that nearly all audits reported an impact factor over 0.8, a rule of thumb often used in employment discrimination cases. We also find that the benefit of LL 144 to ordinary job seekers is limited due to shortcomings in accessibility and usability. Our findings offer important lessons for policy-makers as they consider regulating algorithmic systems, particularly the degree of discretion to grant to regulated parties and the limitations of relying on transparency and end-user accountability. \u00a9 2024 Owner/Author.",

    "abstract": "AI-based automated hiring systems cover a wide range of tools of varying complexity, from resume parsing tools to candidate selection models. Their close interference in economic and social life faces raising demands and investigations aiming to reduce the potential discrimination they may cause. This article covers the intersection of EU non-discrimination law and algorithmic fairness in the context of automated hiring systems. The paper analyzes the balance between equality of opportunity (formal and substantive) and equality of outcome, critiques the focus on non-conservative group fairness in machine learning, and discusses the legal implications of automated hiring systems under EU law. Additionally, it highlights often committed fallacies in relation to the process of de-biasing and advocates for a broader understanding of fairness in machine learning that aligns with EU legal standards and societal values. \u00a9 2024 Owner/Author.",

    "abstract": "An increasing number of regulations propose 'AI audits' as a mechanism for achieving transparency and accountability for artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Despite some converging norms around various forms of AI auditing, auditing for the purpose of compliance and assurance currently lacks agreed-upon practices, procedures, taxonomies, and standards. We propose the 'criterion audit' as an operationalizable compliance and assurance external audit framework. We model elements of this approach after financial auditing practices, and argue that AI audits should similarly provide assurance to their stakeholders about AI organizations' ability to govern their algorithms in ways that mitigate harms and uphold human values. We discuss the necessary conditions for the criterion audit and provide a procedural blueprint for performing an audit engagement in practice. We illustrate how this framework can be adapted to current regulations by deriving the criteria on which 'bias audits' can be performed for in-scope hiring algorithms, as required by the recently effective New York City Local Law 144 of 2021. We conclude by offering a critical discussion on the benefits, inherent limitations, and implementation challenges of applying practices of the more mature financial auditing industry to AI auditing where robust guardrails against quality assurance issues are only starting to emerge. Our discussion - informed by experiences in performing these audits in practice - highlights the critical role that an audit ecosystem plays in ensuring the effectiveness of audits. \u00a9 2024 ACM.",

What factors help to explain this low acceptance rate and are all job applicants equally affected? Across three controlled experiments, we demonstrate that job applicants perceive an AI evaluation agent (vs. a human) as less trustworthy, which reduced their job acceptance intentions (Study 1). This effect was stronger for job applicants who scored low on avoidant attachment style (Study 2). Using a serial mediation model, Study 3 tested one explanatory mechanism for how avoidant attachment style shapes trust, finding that perceptions of the AI agent's ability to parse unique skills are an antecedent of job applicants' low trust toward the AI. These findings deepen our understanding of the factors that shape applicants\u2019 job acceptance intentions regarding AI and provide actionable insights for integrating AI into hiring practices. \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Inc.",

    "abstract": "Automated decision-making systems are commonly used by human resources to automate recruitment decisions. Most automated decision-making systems utilize machine learning to screen, assess, and give recommendations on candidates. Algorithmic bias and prejudice are common side-effects of these technologies that result in data-driven discrimination. However, proof of this is often unavailable due to the statistical complexities and operational opacities of machine learning, which interferes with the abilities of complainants to meet the requisite causal requirements of the EU equality directives. In direct discrimination, the use of machine learning prevents complainants from demonstrating a prima facie case. In indirect discrimination, the problems mainly manifest once the burden has shifted to the respondent, and causation operates as a quasi-defence by reference to objectively justified factors unrelated to the discrimination. This paper argues that causation must be understood as an informational challenge that can be addressed in three ways. First, through the fundamental rights lens of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. Second, through data protection measures such as the General Data Protection Regulation. Third, the article also considers the future liabilities that may arise under incoming legislation such as the Artificial Intelligence Act and the Artificial Intelligence Liability Directive proposal. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2024.",

Using machine learning models in this field might be beneficial but requires some unique considerations in how organizations govern, assure, audit, and support the use of AI. While substantial work has been done on AI ethics, organizational implantation studies are rare and often anecdotal, particularly in HR. In this article, we would like to better understand the common ethical considerations and organizational responses for developing AI for HR use and how different organizations engage with them by comparing two case studies. This paper begins by reviewing AI ethical issues specific to HR and describes the common mitigation strategies proposed in the literature. After this introduction, case studies are illustrated, and the organizational responses in both cases are analyzed. The discussion section shows that although the organizations were aware of the AI ethics issues, their responses varied and depended on different governance and self-regulation mechanisms that might have impinged their ability to proactively engage with ethical issues. A second finding is that the organization used only a relatively small set of mitigation strategies proposed in the literature, and we propose several reasons for this. These insights might be important to various organizations deploying or developing AI for HR use that want better governance, assurance, and audit mechanisms to responsibly address the ethical issues raised by AI in this field. \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd",

The article commences with a characterization of big data applications in HRM processes and practices, highlighting their benefits and value for the management of the workforce. It also shows how the application of big data analytics can put employees at great risk through institutional surveillance and other algorithmic manipulation practices such as profiling, coercion and control. Our theorizing advances the HRM and ethics literatures by offering a more expanded and nuanced view of the significant ethical challenges specific to individual HR practices. Additionally, our analysis brings ethics into the domain of HRM by problematizing the exploitation of employee information through digital technology for corporate gain. In so doing, it employs a moral principles framework to show how BDA - HRM practices can compromise employees' rights to privacy, confidentiality, transparency, and protection. Our analysis also raises concerns shared by both the practitioner and scholarly communities that are yet to be addressed and offers recommendations for research and practice. \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Inc.",

In this study, we examined 46,214 ratings from 4947 interviews to ascertain if gender differences in ratings were related to interactions among content (stereotype-relevant competencies), context (occupational gender composition), and rater type (human vs. algorithm). Contrary to the hypothesized effects of smaller gender differences in algorithmic scoring than with human raters, we found that both human and algorithmic ratings of men on agentic competencies were higher than those given to women. Also unexpected, the algorithmic scoring evidenced greater gender differences in communal ratings than humans (with women rated higher than men) and similar differences in non-stereotypic competency ratings that were in the opposite direction (humans rated men higher than women, while algorithms rated women higher than men). In more female-dominated occupations, humans tended to rate applicants as generally less competent overall relative to the algorithms, but algorithms rated men more highly in these occupations.

    "abstract": "Competence development in digital technologies, analytics, and artificial intelligence is increasingly important to all types of organizations and their workforce. Universities and corporations are investing heavily in developing training programs, at all tenure levels, to meet the new skills needs. However, there is a risk that the new set of lucrative opportunities for employees in these tech-heavy fields will be biased against diverse demographic groups like women. Although much research has examined the experiences of women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields and occupations, less understood is the extent to which gender stereotypes influence recruiters\u2019 perceptions and evaluations of individuals who are deciding whether to apply to STEM training programs. These behaviors are typically unobserved because they occur prior to the application interface. We address this question by investigating recruiters\u2019 initial outreach decisions to more than 166,000 prospective students who have expressed interest in applying to a midcareer level online tech training program in business analytics. Using data on the recruiters\u2019 communications, our results indicate that recruiters are less likely to initiate contact with female than male prospects and search for additional signals of quality from female prospects before contacting them. We also find evidence that recruiters are more likely to base initial outreach activities on prospect gender when they have higher workloads and limited attention. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of this research for our understanding of how screening and selection decisions prior to the application interface may undermine organizational efforts to achieve gender equality and diversity as well as the potential for demand-side interventions to mitigate these gender disparities. \u00a9 2023 The Author(s)",

Given that an organization\u2019s sustainability is significantly influenced by individuals\u2019 perceptions of fairness, this study takes a resume-screening scenario as an example to explore the impact of AI replacing humans on applicants\u2019 perceptions of fairness. This study adopts the method of the online scenario experiment and uses SPSS to analyze the experimental data: 189 and 214 people, respectively, participated in two online scenarios, with two independent variables of decision makers (AI and humans), two dependent variables of procedural and distributive fairness, and two moderating variables of outcome favorability and the expertise of AI. The results show that the applicants tend to view AI screening resumes as less fair than humans. Furthermore, moderating effects exist between the outcome favorability and the expertise of AI. This study reveals the impact of AI substituting for humans in decision-making on fairness. The proposed model can help organizations use AI to screen resumes more effectively. And future research can explore the collaboration between humans and AI to make human resource management decisions. \u00a9 2024 by the authors.",

However, research on psychometric properties of AVIs is limited. In this study, 710 participants completed a mock AVI responding to eight personality questions (Extraversion, Conscientiousness). We collected self- and observer reports of personality, interview performance ratings, attractiveness, and AVI meta-information (e.g., professional attire, audio quality). Then, we automatically extracted the words, facial expressions, and voice characteristics from the videos and trained machine learning models to predict the personality traits and interview performance. Our algorithm explained substantially more variance in observer reports of Extraversion and Conscientiousness (average R2 = 0.32) and interview performance (R2 = 0.44), than self-reported Extraversion and Conscientiousness (average R2 = 0.12). Consistent with Trait Activation Theory, the explained variance in personality traits increased when participants responded to trait-relevant, compared to trait-irrelevant, questions. The test-retest reliability of our algorithm was somewhat stable over a time period of seven months, but lower than desired reliability standards in personnel selection. We examined potential sources of bias, including age, gender, and attractiveness, and found some instances of algorithmic bias (e.g., gender differences were often amplified in favor of women). \u00a9 2024 The Authors",

In this, we do not explicitly frame our questions as questions of algorithmic fairness, but rather relate them to current human hiring practice. As our findings show, while many notions are well understood, fairness, potential to increase diversity and practical applicability are rated differently, illustrating the importance of understanding the application domain and its nuances, and calling for more interdisciplinary and human-centered research into the perception of mathematical fairness notions. \u00a9 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",

    "abstract": "Why do organizations conduct job interviews? The traditional view of interviewing holds that interviews are conducted, despite their steep costs, to predict a candidate's future performance and fit. This view faces a twofold threat: the behavioral and algorithmic threats. Specifically, an overwhelming body of behavioral research suggests that we are bad at predicting performance and fit; furthermore, algorithms are already better than us at making these predictions in various domains. If the traditional view captures the whole story, then interviews seem to be a costly, archaic human resources procedure sustained by managerial overconfidence. However, building on T. M. Scanlon's work, we offer the value of choice theory of interviewing and argue that interviews can be vindicated once we recognize that they generate commonly overlooked kinds of noninstrumental value. On our view, interviews should thus not be entirely replaced by algorithms, however sophisticated algorithms ultimately become at predicting performance and fit. \u00a9 The Author(s), 2023.

Design/methodology/approach: The research employed the use of experts to evaluate the outputs from ChatGPT's AI tool in blind tests to review the accuracy and value of outcomes for written content and for coaching conversations. Findings: The results from these tasks indicate that there is a significant gap between comparative search tools such as Google Scholar, specialist online discovery tools (EBSCO and PsycNet) and GPT-4's performance. GPT-4 lacks the accuracy and detail which can be found through other tools, although the material produced has strong face validity. It argues organisations, academic institutions and training providers should put in place policies regarding the use of such tools, and professional bodies should amend ethical codes of practice to reduce the risks of false claims being used in published work.

    "abstract": "The growing uses of algorithm-based decision-making in human resources management have drawn considerable attention from different stakeholders. While prior literature mainly focused on stakeholders directly related to HR decisions (e.g., employees), this paper pertained to a third-party observer perspective and investigated how consumers would respond to companies\u2019 adoption of algorithm-based HR decision-making. Through five experimental studies, we showed that the adoption of algorithm-based (vs. human-based) HR decision-making could induce consumers\u2019 unfavorable ethicality inferences of the company (study 1); because implementing a calculative and data-driven approach (i.e. algorithm-based) to make employee-related decisions violates the deontological principles of respectful employee treatment (study 2). However, this effect was attenuated when consumers had high (vs. low) power distance beliefs (study 3); the algorithm served as assistance (vs. replacement) for human decisions (study 4); or the adoption was framed as employee-oriented (vs. company-oriented) motivated (study 5). Our findings suggested that consumers are aversive to algorithm-based HR decision-making because it is deontologically problematic regardless of its decision quality (i.e. accuracy). This paper contributes to the extant understanding of stakeholders\u2019 responses to algorithm-based HR decision-making and consumers\u2019 attitudes toward algorithm users. \u00a9 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.",

    "abstract": "Human resource management (HRM) is a paramount body of any working organization. The tasks and activities associated with HRM are more important than ever before in current times. With major technological advances related to artificial intelligence (AI), the inclusion of techniques based on AI is becoming increasingly common in human resource tasks. Smart automation technologies based on machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) constitute a new approach to managing employees as well as other resources. These technologies result in enhanced organizational performance, thus offering several opportunities for HRM and at the same time, considerable challenges at a technological and ethical level. In the context of OCB, machine learning-based solutions could assist organizations to identify the appropriate candidates at the recruitment stage itself. However, a special issue faced in the context of OCB as a construct emerges since they are behaviours that are not formally recognized in the usual reward system. Building algorithms and providing accurate and representative training data may pose significant challenges. This chapter provides readers with an overview of the contemporary applications of AI in HRM. The benefits and limitations of some of these especially in the context of OCB are discussed. \u00a9 The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the Swedish Public Employment Service (PES), focusing on the concept of trustworthy AI in public decision-making. Despite Sweden's advanced digitalization efforts and the widespread application of AI in the public sector, our study reveals significant gaps between theoretical ambitions and practical outcomes, particularly in the context of AI's trustworthiness. We employ a robust theoretical framework comprising Institutional Theory, the Resource-Based View (RBV), and Ambidexterity Theory, to analyze the challenges and discrepancies in AI implementation within PES. Our analysis shows that while AI promises enhanced decision-making efficiency, the reality is marred by issues of transparency, interpretability, and stakeholder engagement. The opacity of the neural network used by the agency to assess jobseekers\u2019 need for support and the lack of comprehensive technical understanding among PES management contribute to the challenges in achieving transparent and interpretable AI systems. Economic pressures for efficiency often overshadow the need for ethical considerations and stakeholder involvement, leading to decisions that may not be in the best interest of jobseekers. We propose recommendations for enhancing AI's trustworthiness in public services, emphasizing the importance of stakeholder engagement, particularly involving jobseekers in the decision-making process. Our study advocates for a more nuanced balance between the use of advanced AI technologies and the leveraging of internal resources such as skilled personnel and organizational knowledge. We also highlight the need for improved AI literacy among both management and personnel to effectively navigate AI's integration into public decision-making processes. Our findings contribute to the ongoing debate on trustworthy AI, offering a detailed case study that bridges the gap between theoretical exploration and practical application. By scrutinizing the AI implementation in the Swedish PES, we provide valuable insights and guidelines for other public sector organizations grappling with the integration of AI into their decision-making processes. \u00a9 2024 The Authors",

    "abstract": "Predictive algorithmic scores can significantly impact the lives of assessed individuals by shaping decisions of organizations and institutions that affect them, for example, influencing the hiring prospects of job applicants or the release of defendants on bail. To better protect people and provide them the opportunity to appeal their algorithmic assessments, data privacy advocates and regulators increasingly push for disclosing the scores and their use in decision-making processes to scored individuals. Although inherently important, the response of scored individuals to such algorithmic transparency is understudied and therefore demands further research. Inspired by psychological and economic theories of information processing, we aim to fill this gap. We conducted a comprehensive experimental study with five treatment conditions to explore how and why disclosing the use of algorithmic scoring processes to (involuntarily) scored individuals affects their behaviors. Our results provide strong evidence that the disclosure of fundamentally erroneous algorithmic scores evokes self-fulfilling prophecies that endogenously steer the behavior of scored individuals toward their assessment, enabling algorithms to help produce the world they predict. Occurring self-fulfilling prophecies are consistent with an anchoring effect and the exploitation of available moral wiggle room. Because scored individuals interpret others\u2019 motives for overriding human expert and algorithmic scores differently, self-fulfilling prophecies occur in part only when disclosing algorithmic scores. Our results emphasize that isolated transparency measures can have considerable side effects with noticeable implications for the development of automation bias, the occurrence of feedback loops, and the design of transparency regulations. \u00a9 2024 INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences.

Noting socially responsible AI (SRAI) as a new concept in the field of PA and HRD, we delved into the subject through an integrative literature review of 75 articles and incorporated three sustainability concepts into AI-enabled PA: corporate social responsibility (CSR), environment, social, and governance (ESG), and UN sustainable development goals (SDGs). Through a stakeholder view, we identified major SRAI stakeholders (subjects) and analyzed their essential considerations (objectives), the impediments of AI technology (causes), and the solutions (means). The analysis illuminated key requirements and considerations for enhancing AI-enabled PA to SRAI-empowered PA towards sustainability. Moreover, we proposed a holistic framework to thoroughly understand SRAI in theory and provided practical implications, recommendations, and future research directions for HRD scholars and professionals. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2023.",

    "abstract": "In two studies, we examined the effects of algorithm-based (vs. recruiter-based) evaluations of an asynchronous video interview and a personality inventory on applicant reactions. In line with our expectations, we found several negative applicant reactions to the use of algorithms. Specifically, in Study 1 (N = 172), informing participants that an algorithm, rather than a recruiter, had analysed their interview and personality inventory increased feelings of emotional creepiness, and reduced fairness perceptions, perceived predictive validity and feedback acceptance. In Study 2 (N = 276), we were able to replicate these effects for fairness perceptions and perceived predictive validity. Furthermore, in both studies, algorithm-based evaluations negatively affected feedback acceptance, organizational attraction and job acceptance intentions through fairness perceptions. However, in contrast with our expectations, selection decision favourability did not influence the impact of evaluation source (recruiter vs. algorithm) on applicant reactions. In Study 2, we also found some tentative evidence that applicant reactions to algorithm-based evaluations are not affected by the type of information source (i.e. verbal vs. nonverbal cues) on which the algorithm is based. \u00a9 2023 The Authors.

Methods: A quantitative survey approach, with 469 professionals participating in an online survey, was used. Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) in Amos SPSS was used in the analysis of the relationships between Generative AI Tools, User Familiarity with AI, and key outcomes in the recruitment process. Results: The study reveals a significant reduction in bias during candidate screening, attributed to the algorithmic objectivity, data driven decision making, and consistency inherent in Generative AI Tools. Efficiency gains and heightened accuracy in shortlisting candidates were also observed. However, User Familiarity with AI emerged as a moderating factor in influencing the relationship between Generative AI Tools and efficiency improvement. Discussion: As a recommendation, organizations are encouraged to invest in continuous training programs to harness the full potential of Generative AI Tools in optimizing efficiency and ensuring a fair and accurate recruitment process. \u00a9 \u00a9 2025 Abdelhay, AlTalay, Selim, Altamimi, Hassan, Elbannany and Marie.",

    "abstract": "In the modern business landscape, effective human resources management (HRM) stands as a linchpin for organizational success, with machine learning (ML) emerging as a transformative force in revolutionizing HR practices (Kess-Momoh et al. in World J Adv Res Rev 21(1):746\u2013757, 2024). This review paper delves into the multifaceted applications, challenges, and prospects of ML within HRM. ML integration has fundamentally reshaped recruitment processes, facilitating automated resume screening, candidate selection, and predictive analytics for talent acquisition (Paramita in digitalization in talent acquisition: a case study of AI in recruitment, 2020). By leveraging ML algorithms, organizations can efficiently sift through vast candidate pools while mitigating biases inherent in traditional recruitment methods (Vishwanath and Vaddepalli in Tuijin Jishu/J Propul Technol 44(3):2023, 2023). Beyond recruitment, ML holds promise in talent management, enabling predictive modeling to identify high-potential employees and tailor personalized training and development plans (Sheshadri in Glob J Bus Integral Secur, 2016). Succession planning is likewise enhanced through ML-driven strategies, ensuring organizational continuity by grooming future leaders. Employee engagement and retention, crucial factors for organizational sustainability, are also revolutionized by ML. Sentiment analysis of employee feedback provides valuable insights into workforce morale, while predictive modeling helps identify turnover factors, allowing for targeted retention strategies (Garg et al. in Int J Prod Perform Manag 71(5):1590\u20131610, 2022). Nonetheless, the widespread adoption of ML in HRM is accompanied by ethical and technical challenges. Concerns regarding algorithmic biases and data privacy necessitate initiative-taking measures to ensure fairness and transparency. Moreover, integrating ML with existing HRM systems presents technical hurdles, including data integration and system compatibility issues. Despite these challenges, the future of ML in HRM appears promising, with opportunities for improved efficiency, effectiveness, and employee satisfaction. Through case studies and real-world examples, this review paper underscores the practical implications of ML in HRM, offering insights to practitioners, researchers, and policymakers seeking to harness ML\u2019s transformative potential to drive organizational success and foster a thriving workforce. \u00a9 The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",

An increasing number of tactical procedures have begun to use AI. Training and development systems, disciplinary action management, compensation and benefit analysis, employee satisfaction surveys, and performance reviews are all part of this. We plan to read up on articles and books that cover the topic of AI in HRM so that we can better grasp this new trend. This research intends to illuminate the pros and cons of artificial intelligence (AI) in the context of the hiring process, which stands to be significantly altered by this technology. This article takes a look at several AI-powered recruitment strategies and weighs the benefits and drawbacks of using AI in this industry. Social media screening, video interviews, chatbots, predictive analytics, gamification, and resume screening are all examples of AI-based recruiting tactics that might greatly benefit businesses, according to the results. Efficient hiring, cost savings, and improved talent acquisition are all possible outcomes of implementing these tactics. Still, there are certain legitimate moral and legal questions that arise from using AI for hiring purposes, such as the possibility of algorithmic prejudice and discrimination. \u00a9 2024 IEEE.",

However, there is a gap in knowledge concerning the ethical implications of PA research, which could lead to unethical research topics, methods, or low credibility of PA evidence generated in academia. Implementing ethical practices in PA research is challenging since the field is complex, involving multiple scientific disciplines. To address these challenges and to inform future PA research, we discuss how a number of (inter)national ethical codes from PA-relevant disciplines could be applied throughout the PA research lifecycle. The chapter highlights ethical issues that can arise in PA research and emphasizes the importance of ethics across all research lifecycle phases. It thus raises awareness and sets an agenda for future research. \u00a9 2024 Edward Elgar Publishing.",

    "abstract": "The appraisal system in organizations has been plagued by several challenges, including inefficiency, discrimination, perceived unfairness, and an operational-focused approach. These issues hinder the effectiveness of performance appraisal processes, leading to suboptimal outcomes. Previous studies have highlighted these problems and proposed alternative approaches like coaching-oriented system which focuses on employee behavior and leadership development, while also advocating for the separation of appraisal from rewards to mitigate biases. However, there are gaps remain in addressing the limitations of automated systems such as the crucial role played by the quality and diversity of the training data in determining the accuracy and efficiency of the NLP model, along with acknowledging the irreplaceable role of human involvement. Our study aimed to address these issues by automating the feedback review process using a transfer learning model, enhancing accuracy, efficiency, objectivity, and scalability. This study implements the BERT model from Hugging Face and achieves promising validation metrics of better performance when compared to other language models such as Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models. It is proved that biases and decision-making process in the traditional appraisal system can be improved with the deployment of advanced NLP models such as BERT. Furthermore, this model promotes a more equitable and transparent workplace environment by scaling and consistency in performance review. \u00a9 2024 IEEE.",

    ],
    "year": 2024,
    "abstract": "Although the EU prohibition of direct and indirect discrimination under non-discrimination law theoretically applies to algorithmic recruitment, doubts exist about whether the prohibition can tackle algorithmic recruitment discrimination in practical terms. This article examines two significant obstacles to dealing with direct discrimination identified in prior research: ambiguity in determining whether proxy discrimination constitutes direct discrimination, and the incapacity of job applicants to meet the burden of proof. First, the analysis of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) case law suggests that the inextricable link doctrine could apply to proxies used by algorithmic recruitment systems, assuming that the proxies are comprehensible and detectable. In cases in which the proxies remain unintelligible or invisible, it might still be possible to show that the protected ground determined the decision to impose less favourable treatment. Thus, proxy discrimination in algorithmic systems could constitute direct discrimination. Moreover, the direct discrimination prohibition could deal with more proxy discrimination cases if the applicability of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (CFREU) is acknowledged when an EU Regulation directly applies to algorithmic recruitment. Second, the research discloses that the burden of proof could be interpreted in a way which allows applicants to establish prima facie cases of algorithmic recruitment discrimination even if they lack access to detailed information about the workings of the algorithmic recruitment system. The challenges of direct discrimination in algorithmic recruitment might not be insuperable, and the prohibition of direct discrimination should not be sidestepped when analysing the discriminatory tendencies of algorithmic recruitment. \u00a9 2024 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands",

    "abstract": "Recent research has underscored the pivotal role of soft skills in navigating the complexities of today's workplace dynamics. Soft skills encompass a broad spectrum of attributes, such as effective communication, adept collaboration, nimble adaptability, and profound emotional intelligence, all of which are integral to fostering productive team environments and driving organizational success. Despite their acknowledged importance, quantifying and evaluating soft skills has traditionally been hindered by their inherently subjective nature. However, the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies has revolutionized the landscape of skill assessment, presenting novel opportunities to address these longstanding challenges. By leveraging AI-powered algorithms, organizations can now analyze vast datasets encompassing various facets of human interaction, enabling a more nuanced and objective evaluation of individuals' soft skill proficiencies. Moreover, AI-driven assessments offer scalability, allowing for the efficient evaluation of large cohorts of employees or candidates. Nonetheless, this intersection of AI and soft skills measurement is not without its obstacles. Ethical considerations surrounding data privacy, algorithmic bias, and the potential for automation-induced job displacement necessitate careful scrutiny and regulation. Furthermore, the dynamic nature of soft skills presents a continuous challenge, as individuals must continually adapt and refine their abilities to meet evolving workplace demands. Despite these challenges, the synergistic relationship between AI and soft skills measurement holds immense promise for the future of talent assessment and development. By embracing AI-driven approaches, organizations can cultivate a workforce equipped with the diverse skill set necessary to thrive in an ever-changing professional landscape. \u00a9 2024 Polish Information Processing Society.",

Using the scenario planning method and Dator\u2019s Alternative Futures Framework, four 2035 alternative scenarios were constructed. These scenarios served as a foundation for 3 group and 30 individual scenario-planning sessions with international industry experts and academics, epistemologically aligning the process with exploring the uncertain future of AI. The thematic analysis of the data underscored the importance of balanced integration that enhances rather than replaces human roles. Ethical considerations, the human-centric essence of tourism and hospitality, and the need for ongoing education and skill development in response to AI advancements were considered central. This study\u2019s novel contribution is a conceptual framework to guide AI integration in tourism and hospitality talent management, contributing to the theoretical and practical understanding of AI\u2019s role in talent management. \u00a9 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, Human Capital Management (HCM) is seen as a service whose consumers are current and potential future employees. Some trends pushing the HCM operations to new approaches are the rise of individualization and flexible work as well as the changing expectations and values that new generations X and Y bring to the way people management is evolving. Companies need new tools and approaches along the lifecycle of their employee relations \u2013 from applicant pool construction and maintenance to recruitment and training. In SME companies the management is likely to address HCM needs on a very individual level. However, larger companies need to categorize their human capital into certain entities to mass-customize their HCM services. This paper explores the proponents and challenges in the usability of the Persona concept for HCM. Persona is a service design approach widely applied in marketing, and a few research papers have argued that personas may have a role in improved people-oriented HCM. Personas \u2013 as commonly used in the sphere of marketing - aim to create a limited set of archetypes that differ from each other. Whereas the traditional customer and employee clustering methods leaned heavily on demographics (age, experience, job title, etc.), the persona concept adds psychographic elements like values, and social engagement to form the basis of service development and delivery. The contents of personas are often a mix of real-life data-backed facts of people existing and some imaginary attributes. Different personas will likely request different services to feel fully motivated and supported. This paper studies the awareness of personas among HCM experts across industries and countries as well as the ideas for personas in HCM by marketing professional more used with the use of personas in their profession. The qualitative study based on twelve semi-structured individual interviews was conducted in November-December 2022. The results indicate that the HCM community knows about the persona concept and early adoptions or plans for implementation are ongoing. However, the current usage of personas is mainly focused on employer branding and recruitment (the most marketing-type of HCM actions), and only in a few cases does the usage cover the spectrum of internal HCM processes. The study also revealed some limitations for HCM that are not present in the marketing field. Demands for transparency, equality, data privacy, and personal integrity set challenges in clustering the workforce. The novel technical solutions such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) in persona creation offer efficiency and a deeper analytical foundation in persona development but also bring in new questions of transparency and ethicality of their use. The results indicate the further need for research on best practices of creating and using Personas in a way that ethically and legally serves the interests of both the company and the employee. \u00a9 2024 Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited.

Starting with structured analysis of the background and rationale of using algorithms in Human Resources Management, it begins with how algorithmic Human Resources Management differs from e-HRM concept and how it fits into the continuum of Human Resources Management digitalisation. Differentiation of algorithm-based Human Resources Management systems is presented according to the level of automation of people-related decision-making, scope of the autonomy of managers and workers (including monitoring and control mechanisms), as well as its role within the Human Resources Management processes (workforce planning, recruitment and selection, performance management and remuneration). While the topic of algorithmic Human Resources Management is still under-researched, review of empirical evidence on the use of algorithms in Human Resources Management is provided, including recent research into the digitalisation of workplaces from European-level organisations.

    "abstract": "This study explores the transformative role of artificial intelligence (AI) in human resource management (HRM), focusing on key functions such as recruitment, retention, and performance management. A comprehensive review was carried out PRISMA framework and BERTopic model on AI and HRM\u2011related keywords. The resulting publications were analyzed to extract meaningful topics. AI\u2011driven tools streamline candidate screening and interview analysis, significantly enhancing hiring efficiency and decision\u2011making accuracy. Concerns about algorithmic bias highlight the need for robust governance frameworks to ensure transparency and fairness in AI\u2011driven processes. The study emphasizes the importance of aligning AI adoption with Organizational Development principles to foster inclusivity and organizational justice. The integration of AI in performance management facilitates real\u2011time, objective performance assessments, although overreliance on such technologies can affect employee trust and engagement. Despite these advances, the study highlights ethical concerns surrounding data privacy and the potential for algorithmic bias. Addressing these challenges requires the implementation of comprehensive ethical frameworks to promote fairness and inclusivity in AI\u2011HRM applications. Strategically, AI transforms HR from a reactive function to a proactive, data\u2011driven partner aligned with long\u2011term organizational goals. Successful AI integration depends on governance mechanisms that uphold ethical standards, foster employee trust, and ensure transparency, enabling organizations to fully leverage AI\u2019s potential in enhancing workforce management. \u00a9 2024 The Author(s).

Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on empirical data from 225 human resource managers from Ghana, data were sourced from senior human resource managers across industries such as banking, insurance, media, telecommunication, oil and gas and manufacturing. Data were analysed using a fussy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). Findings: The results indicated that managers who regarded their response to AI bias as a personal moral duty felt a strong sense of guilt towards the unintended consequences of AI logic and reasoning. Therefore, managers who perceived the processes that guide AI algorithms' reasoning as discriminating showed a high propensity to address this prejudicial outcome. Practical implications: As awareness of consequences has to go hand in hand with an ascription of responsibility; organisational heads have to build the capacity of their HR managers to recognise the importance of taking personal responsibility for artificial intelligence algorithm bias because, by failing to nurture the appropriate attitude to reinforce personal norm among managers, no immediate action will be taken. Originality/value: By integrating the social identity theory, norm activation theory and justice theory, the study improves our understanding of how a collective organisational identity, perception of justice and personal values reinforce a positive reactive response towards AI bias outcomes. \u00a9 2024, Kwadwo Asante, David Sarpong and Derrick Boakye.",

It examines how these automated systems affect fundamental worker interests and how existing law applies, focusing primarily on non-discrimination and privacy. Although current law provides some protections, it fails to fully apprehend the risks posed by algorithmic tools. Current legal doctrine prohibits discrimination by workplace algorithms but fits awkwardly with the nature of automated decision systems, leaving gaps and uncertainties. Traditional worker privacy protections are ill-equipped to address the volume and granularity of worker data collected today, and the ability of computational techniques to extract new insights and infer sensitive information from that data. The expansion of algorithmic management affects other fundamental worker interests by increasing employer power vis-\u00e0-vis labour. This chapter concludes by briefly considering the role that data protection laws might play in addressing the risks of algorithmic management. \u00a9 Oxford University Press 2024.",

    "abstract": "This article considers the managerial aspect of digital transformation \u2014 various programs and infrastructure that have recently received the general name \u201calgorithmic management\u201d. The boom in the use of such tools occurred during the covid-19 pandemic as a unique set of circumstances for the digitalization of human life. The authorities of several countries monitored their citizens\u2019 behavior, including with the QR-code systems that limited their rights, in the fight against the spread of the covid-19, which has caused discussions and even protests. Businesses accelerated their digital transformation in HR management due to government restrictions and lockdown measures and to production needs in the new conditions. Quarantines are over, but the active development of algorithmic management continues; it extends beyond the platform economy and plays an integral role in Industry 4.0, which makes the study of algorithmic management relevant and timely. A significant contribution to understanding algorithmic management was made by the report of the experts from the European Commission and International Labor Organization. Based on the relevant publications up to 2022, they suggested giving up the narrow understanding of algorithmic management as a platform economy issue; however, most studies are still based on this interpretation. The article presents a broader definition to identify additional social contradictions and challenges of digital transformation. The author considers algorithmic management in the perspective of sociology of management and sociology of technology, in particular the works of A. Feenberg and P. Edwards. The approach of sociology of technologies studies (STS) allowed the author not only to analyze the events of the recent pandemic but also to consider the future of such technologies under the transition towards Industry 4.0. The article identifies three elements of algorithmic management together with hidden social-managerial biases and contradictions related to their implementation and shows how the new approach integrates direct and indirect control in management. \u00a9 M.A. Yudina, 2024.",

However, the emphasis is put on predictive analytics, which is applied to raise the retention rates of employees. Through the use of a deep feedforward neural network, the researchers investigate a variety of datasets containing among others attributes concerning demographics, job performance, engagement, and turnover for several large organizations. The research will be the mixed-method approach, which combines quantitative approaches to apply the predictive models by practical applicability from HR professionals and employees. The outcomes show that deep learning has a remarkably high level of efficiency over traditional predictive models and it produces higher accuracies, precisions, recalls, and F1 scores in predicting employee turnover. This points out the fact that deep learning could be the future of HR analytics because it allows for building more accurate and earlier forecasts and so it entails management strategies that are oriented to the retention of valuable HR. Despite this, the use of these highly sophisticated systems poses significant ethical issues like those of data privacy and the transparency of algorithms, which the study discusses concretely. \u00a9 2024 IEEE.",

    "abstract": "The current business environment requires creativity in ensuring the restructuring of human resources. The conventional talent management approaches are often inadequate because most of these practices are done on benches and involve a lot of judgment. This research paper aims to review how machine learning has been adopted in various aspects of talent management such as Talent acquisition; employee performance management; employee retention; and employee development. Overall, this work applies and outlines how machine learning can be utilized as a tool to achieve effective insights, HR process contextuality, and better decision-making accuracy. Major machine learning algorithms include logistic regression, random forests, support vector machines, and neural networks. Among the models, the neural network model was the best with the highest accuracy of 98.34%, highest AUC-ROC of 99.29%, lowest log loss of 0.015, and mean absolute error of 0.098. The conclusion made by the study reveals how the application of machine learning can enhance talent management and make it possible for organizations to perform better. This study also casts light on issues of data privacies, and security, as well as the concerns of algorithmic unfairness, stating for ethical and explicative, approaches to ML. The results only serve to highlight the promises machine learning can deliver to revolutionize traditional HR practices in support of strategic organizational goals. \u00a9 2024 IEEE.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates the transformative impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on human resource management (HRM) practices through a quantitative descriptive approach. Data were collected from 285 employees and 144 HR professionals across seven organizations using purposive sampling to explore AI's influence on recruitment, performance assessment, job satisfaction, and workforce planning. A key novelty of this research lies in its comprehensive analysis of AI's holistic influence on HRM dynamics, going beyond isolated aspects of AI implementation. Findings reveal that organizations leveraging AI in HR processes experience significantly higher recruitment efficiency and employee productivity compared to those without AI integration. Moreover, successful adaptation to AI in HR correlates with increased levels of employee job satisfaction and reduced turnover rates, highlighting AI's potential to enhance organizational performance and employee well-being. Additionally, positive perceptions of AI in HR positively correlate with elevated levels of organizational trust and employee engagement. These insights contribute to a nuanced understanding of AI's role in reshaping HRM strategies and fostering a supportive workplace environment conducive to sustainable organizational success. Practical implications are discussed to assist HR professionals and organizational leaders in effectively harnessing AI to optimize HR practices and adapt to evolving workforce dynamics. \u00a9 1988-2012 IEEE.",

    "abstract": "Many knowledge workers have shifted to work hybrid by being partly in the office and partly at remote locations. This brings freedom for knowledge workers, but managers are concerned about the performance of their workforce when they are not working from the office. One means to check performance constantly is by collecting and analyzing performance and behavior data to monitor employees, which is a form of algorithmic control. On the one hand, this can lead to conflicts between employees and managers as employees feel that managers mistrust them. On the other hand, employees might trust transparent monitoring that helps them focus on core tasks. To learn more about balancing trust and surveillance, this pilot study surveyed 45 knowledge workers in an engineering company in Denmark, a country with high levels of trust in society. We developed an online survey to investigate managers\u2019 and employees\u2019 opinions about workplace monitoring. We found that all participants had a negative to neutral attitude toward monitoring, although managers were slightly more favorable. Furthermore, data collection for work-related purposes to improve the work situation might be appropriate, although a trustful relationship between managers and employees is the most important. Thus, if a form of monitoring is going to be introduced at the workplace, it is essential that all stakeholders \u2013 managers, employees, HR, and union representatives \u2013 are involved and that complete transparency is achieved in terms of which data is collected and for which purposes. Only then can a balance between trust and surveillance be achieved, including maintaining a positive working climate. \u00a9 2024 Academic Conferences Limited. All rights reserved.",

It defines AI and examines various methods, including machine learning algorithms, natural language processing, recommendation systems, sentiment analysis, data visualization, anomaly detection, expert systems, neural networks, and deep learning. The alignment problem is dissected into key aspects such as defining goals, value misalignment, robustness and safety, long-term consequences, and interpreting human preferences. The types of AI most affected by the alignment problem, including deep learning, reinforcement learning, generative adversarial networks, evolutionary algorithms, and open-ended learning systems, are highlighted. Practical examples illustrate how biases and misalignments manifest in business processes like recruitment, credit scoring, and automated trading. The paper also categorizes managerial decisions and discusses how AI methods support these decisions while addressing alignment issues. This document underscores the importance of aligning AI systems with human values to ensure ethical and effective outcomes in business environments.

    "abstract": "LLMs are increasingly powerful and widely used to assist users in a variety of tasks. This use risks introducing LLM biases into consequential decisions such as job hiring, human performance evaluation, and criminal sentencing. Bias in NLP systems along the lines of gender and ethnicity has been widely studied, especially for specific stereotypes (e.g., Asians are good at math). In this paper, we investigate bias along less-studied but still consequential, dimensions, such as age and beauty, measuring subtler correlated decisions that LLMs make between social groups and unrelated positive and negative attributes. Although these subtler biases are understudied they follow people as much as gender and ethnicity do. So, we want to see whether they also follow one with LLMs. We introduce a template-generated dataset of sentence completion tasks that asks the model to select the most appropriate attribute to complete an evaluative statement about a person described as a member of a specific social group. We also reverse the completion task to select the social group based on an attribute. We report the correlations that we find for 4 cutting-edge LLMs. This dataset can be used as a benchmark to evaluate progress in more generalized biases and the templating technique can be used to expand the benchmark with minimal additional human annotation. \u00a9 2024 Association for Computational Linguistics.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: Artificial intelligence algorithms are increasingly adopted as decisional aides in many contexts such as human resources, often with the promise of being fast, efficient, and even capable of overcoming biases of human decision-makers. Simultaneously, this promise of objectivity and the increasing supervisory role of humans may make it more likely for existing biases in algorithms to be overlooked, as humans are prone to over-rely on such automated systems. This study therefore aims to investigate such reliance on biased algorithmic advice in a hiring context. Method: Simulating the algorithmic pre-selection of applicants we confronted participants with biased or non-biased recommendations in a 1 \u00d7 2 between-subjects online experiment (n = 260). Results: The findings suggest that the algorithmic bias went unnoticed for about 60% of the participants in the bias condition when explicitly asking for this. However, overall individuals relied less on biased algorithms making more changes to the algorithmic scores. Reduced reliance on the algorithms led to the increased noticing of the bias. The biased recommendations did not lower general attitudes toward algorithms but only evaluations for this specific hiring algorithm, while explicitly noticing the bias affected both. Individuals with a more negative attitude toward decision subjects were more likely to not notice the bias. Discussion: This study extends the literature by examining the interplay of (biased) human operators and biased algorithmic decision support systems to highlight the potential negative impacts of such automation for vulnerable and disadvantaged individuals. \u00a9 \u00a9 2024 Rosenthal-von der P\u00fctten and Sach.",

    "abstract": "As artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) continue to advance at an unprecedented pace, their integration into the workplace is reshaping job roles, organizational structures, and talent management practices. This study explores the multifaceted influences of AI/ML technologies on the future of work. Firstly, AI and ML are transforming job roles by automating routine tasks and augmenting human capabilities. While this automation eliminates some traditional jobs, it also generates new opportunities for roles that require complex problem-solving, creativity, and emotional intelligence. Secondly, the integration of AI/ML affects organizational structures by enabling greater flexibility and agility. Hierarchical structures are giving way to flatter, more networked organizations that prioritize collaboration and innovation. AI-powered analytics provide organizations with real-time insights, facilitating data-driven decision-making and enhancing organizational performance. Thirdly, talent management practices are undergoing a paradigm shift in response to AI/ML advancements. Traditional recruitment methods are being supplemented by AI-driven tools that enhance candidate sourcing, screening, and evaluation processes. Additionally, organizations are reevaluating their approaches to employee training and development to ensure alignment with emerging skill requirements. However, the widespread adoption of AI/ML also presents challenges and ethical considerations. Moreover, the digital divide exacerbates existing inequalities, emphasizing the importance of equitable access to training and opportunities for all individuals. To navigate this changing period, it is imperative to embrace technology breakthroughs while maintaining a strong commitment to human-centric principles. Organizations must adopt adaptive strategies that promote innovation, agility, and inclusivity to thrive in the evolving landscape of work. \u00a9 2024 IEEE.",

    "abstract": "Objective: This study aims to explore the implementation and expectations of using chatbots in the personnel recruitment process in Latin American companies, focusing on their application, challenges, and perceived benefits. Theoretical Framework: Personnel recruitment and selection have evolved with the incorporation of Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically through the use of chatbots. The literature highlights AI's ability to automate repetitive tasks, improve the efficiency of the recruitment process, and reduce human biases. However, there is a lack of research in the Latin American context regarding the experience and skills necessary to successfully implement chatbots in recruitment. Method: A multiple case study was conducted in seven Latin American companies from various sectors, using qualitative interviews with human resources professionals and managers. The case study methodology was applied to understand the implementation and expectations of using chatbots in the recruitment process. Transcriptions of the interviews were analyzed using a constructivist approach oriented towards grounded theory. Results and Discussion: The research presents two relevant aspects, previous experience with chatbots and expectations for their use in the recruitment process. Chatbots are primarily used for customer service, replacing traditional methods such as email and phone calls. Best practices include programming aspects, information quality, feedback, and change management. Benefits include the automation of repetitive tasks, improvement in efficiency, and cost reduction, while challenges include proper programming, bias management, and cultural adaptation. Regarding the use of chatbots and the Recruitment Process, their potential benefit in shortening process times was perceived. Various activities were identified where they could be useful, especially in the initial stages of recruitment, although the need for a human component in the final stages to evaluate emotional and aptitude aspects was recognized. Chatbots are considered reliable as a complement in the early stages of the process, but challenges are posed in programming, bias management, and adaptation to recruitment needs. Research Implications: The successful implementation of chatbots in the recruitment process could improve efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance the company's image. However, careful consideration of identified challenges such as proper programming, bias management, and integration with the human component of recruitment is required. \u00a9 2024 ANPAD - Associacao Nacional de Pos-Graduacao e Pesquisa em Administracao.

AI technologies, including Machine Learning (ML), Natural Language Processing (NLP), Robotics Process Automation (RPA), and Predictive Analytics, offer unprecedented opportunities to streamline HR processes, enhance decision-making, and improve overall organizational efficiency. This survey paper explores the multifaceted applications of AI within HRM, focusing on how these technologies are redefining traditional practices in talent management. In talent acquisition, AI-driven tools automate resume screening and facilitate sophisticated candidate search and engagement strategies, enabling a more efficient and effective recruitment process. For talent development, AI applications personalize learning experiences and optimize performance management, addressing individual needs and promoting skill advancement. Additionally, AI's role in talent retention, through predictive turnover models and employee engagement platforms, underscores its potential to significantly lower turnover rates and foster a committed workforce. Despite these advancements, the paper also addresses the challenges and ethical considerations inherent in AI implementation, including algorithmic bias and privacy concerns.

The data were gathered through a survey of 423 respondents working in the manufacturing sector. We use a cross-sectional dataset and various diagnostics (i.e., reliability and collinearity tests). The empirical findings using multivariate regression techniques suggested that Al usage is reshaping the recruitment process by offering innovative solutions to tackle biases that have pervaded the hiring process for years. However, human involvement is indispensable in the recruitment process, alongside the use of AI. Although the use of AI can efficiently handle tasks such as resume screening and data analysis, human judgment brings essential qualities to the hiring process. Human recruiters possess the ability to assess a candidate's soft skills, cultural fit, and emotional intelligence, as these qualities are challenging for AI to comprehend. The policy implications of the study recommend that by combining the strengths of AI efficiency with human insight, organizations can create a recruitment process that is not only objective and efficient but also considerate, ethical, and aligned with the values and goals of the company. \u00a9 1988-2012 IEEE.",

This model is then applied in an empirical study, encompassing data collection and analysis, to evaluate accuracy, identify biases, and measure the system's overall performance. The implementation model, detailed in this paper, encapsulates best practices for the design and deployment of AI-driven recruitment systems, emphasizing the mitigation of biases and the enhancement of transparency. The results of the empirical study furnish insights into the efficiency and equity dimensions of the proposed model.

This study examines the factors of the enterprise survival environment in the process model of human asset management from the perception of control and computing. Based on systematic analysis, this study employs the SWOT is an acronym that stands for Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats, and analysis algorithm to creatively examine the contact of corresponding environmental elements on human resource management mode, and formulates a comprehensive set of human resource development plan. Simultaneously, in light of the control and computer challenges that exist in the human resource model, this study proposes specific implementation rules and methods, and theoretically verifies the efficacy and reliability of the related rules. By eliminating bias, automating tedious procedures, and empowering HR staff to make data-driven judgments, AI may expedite the hiring process. AI may save HR teams time and resources by, for instance, scheduling interviews, reviewing resumes, and performing preliminary candidate screening. It makes possible a data-driven strategy for hiring, promoting, and retaining people that aims to reduce bias and improve the experiences of both job searchers and workers. \u00a9 2024 IEEE.",

    "abstract": "A key challenge facing the use of machine learning (ML) in organizational selection settings (e.g., the processing of loan or job applications) is the potential bias against (racial and gender) minorities. To address this challenge, a rich literature of Fairness-Aware ML (FAML) algorithms has emerged, attempting to ameliorate biases while maintaining the predictive accuracy of ML algorithms. Almost all existing FAML algorithms define their optimization goals according to a selection task, meaning that ML outputs are assumed to be the final selection outcome. In practice, though, ML outputs are rarely used as-is. In personnel selection, for example, ML often serves a support role to human resource managers, allowing them to more easily exclude unqualified applicants. This effectively assigns to ML a screening rather than a selection task. It might be tempting to treat selection and screening as two variations of the same task that differ only quantitatively on the admission rate. This paper, however, reveals a qualitative difference between the two in terms of fairness. Specifically, we demonstrate through conceptual development and mathematical analysis that miscategorizing a screening task as a selection one could not only degrade final selection quality but also result in fairness problems such as selection biases within the minority group. After validating our findings with experimental studies on simulated and real-world data, we discuss several business and policy implications, highlighting the need for firms and policymakers to properly categorize the task assigned to ML in assessing and correcting algorithmic biases. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2024.",

Similarly, the use of AI, as an extension of the digitisation of HRM can also have heuristic rule-based decision-making determining their design. At the same time, behavioural science has also been used to support HRM in the context of behavioural biases, cognitive biases, and heuristic rule-based decision-making. With the synergy between cognitive bias, and heuristic rule-based decision-making, behavioural science has been used to consider the opportunities and costs in applying AI. This chapter combines the literature on AI and HRM, as well as behavioural science and AI, to provide a novel tool for considering the opportunities and costs of applying AI in HRM. The analysis at the intersection of behavioural science, AI, and HRM is gives illustrative examples and debates the opportunities and costs of applying AI in HRM from the perspective of behavioural science. The examples given can be used for further application of behavioural science as a tool for considering the opportunities and costs in applying AI in HRM. \u00a9 The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",

Using a within-subject threat manipulation design, the present research investigated whether business coaches (N = 436; from over 50 different countries) respond to the topic of AI in coaching with heightened threat-related affective states and how this change affects their attitude towards the topic. Expectedly, the topic evoked higher behavioral inhibition and lower behavioral activation threat-related affective states, leading to lower curiosity in and a more negative opinion of AI in coaching. Theoretical and practical implications are addressed to lower the coaches\u2019 threat-related affective states towards AI application in professional services.

    "abstract": "Extant literature points to how the risk of discrimination is intrinsic to AI systems owing to the dependence on training data and the difficulty of post hoc algorithmic auditing. Transparency and auditability limitations are problematic both for companies\u2019 prevention efforts and for government oversight, both in terms of how artificial intelligence (AI) systems function and how large-scale digital platforms support recruitment processes. This article explores the risks and users\u2019 understandings of discrimination when using AI and automated decision-making (ADM) in worker recruitment. We rely on data in the form of 110 completed questionnaires with representatives from 10 of the 50 largest recruitment agencies in Sweden and representatives from 100 Swedish companies with more than 100 employees (\u201cmajor employers\u201d). In this study, we made use of an open definition of AI to accommodate differences in knowledge and opinion around how AI and ADM are understood by the respondents. The study shows a significant difference between direct and indirect AI and ADM use, which has implications for recruiters\u2019 awareness of the potential for bias or discrimination in recruitment. All of those surveyed made use of large digital platforms like Facebook and LinkedIn for their recruitment, leading to concerns around transparency and accountability\u2014not least because most respondents did not explicitly consider this to be AI or ADM use. We discuss the implications of direct and indirect use in recruitment in Sweden, primarily in terms of transparency and the allocation of accountability for bias and discrimination during recruitment processes. \u00a9 2024 by the author(s).",

    "abstract": "As organizations strive to foster diverse and inclusive workplaces, the role of technology, particularly machine learning, becomes crucial in addressing biases inherent in Human Resources (HR) practices. This research explores the application of machine learning algorithms to mitigate biases in recruitment, performance evaluation, and talent management processes, ultimately promoting diversity and inclusion. Biases, whether conscious or unconscious, can affect decision-making at various stages, leading to underrepresentation and disparities within the workforce. Recognizing the need for innovative solutions, this paper advocates for the integration of machine learning techniques to augment HR processes. By leveraging advanced algorithms, organizations can develop unbiased job descriptions, eliminate resume screening biases, and create diverse candidate shortlists. Machine learning models can provide objective insights by analyzing performance metrics, removing subjective biases, and fostering a more equitable assessment of employees. Talent management, the focus of the fourth section, is critical for the retention and development of a diverse workforce. Machine learning algorithms can assist in identifying high-potential employees based on merit, skills, and contributions, thus promoting a fair and inclusive talent pipeline. Addressing concerns related to algorithmic biases, the research suggests guidelines for responsible ML implementation to ensure that technology aligns with organizational values and legal requirements. In conclusion, this research underscores the transformative potential of machine learning in creating more equitable and inclusive workplaces. By addressing biases in HR practices, organizations can harness the power of technology to build diverse teams, foster innovation, and promote a culture of inclusion. However, it also emphasizes the need for ongoing research, collaboration, and ethical considerations to maximize the positive impact of machine learning in shaping the future of HR and workplace diversity. \u00a9 2024 IEEE.",

    "abstract": "Our study dives into the paradigm of AI-based Green HRM (AI-GHRM) and its far-reaching consequences for businesses in an era characterized by the twin imperatives of environmental sustainability and technological progress. Organizational operating paradigms may need to be rethought entirely in light of the revolutionary potential of AI-GHRM, which represents a synergy between AI-driven insights and sustainable HR practices. This study proposes a systematic approach to using AI for optimizing the recruitment and retention of top personnel, lessening negative effects on the environment, and integrating HR and sustainability goals in a harmonic manner. The findings underline the practical advantages of AI-GHRM, from lower employee turnover rates and better work satisfaction to large savings in energy use and carbon emissions. Implications of AI-GHRM for improving operational efficiency, workforce stability, and environmental stewardship are discussed in this light. Readers may glean meaningful insights, gaining a competitive advantage and a broader awareness of the developing landscape of responsible business practices. The study continues by urging businesses to adopt AI-GHRM in order to set a precedent for a future in which operational success is directly correlated with environmental responsibility.

Despite regulations demanding humans in the loop to ensure human oversight of AI-based decisions, it is still unknown how much decision-makers rely on information provided by AI and how this affects (personnel) selection quality. Design/methodology/approach: This paper presents an experimental study using vignettes of dashboard prototypes to investigate the effect of AI on decision-makers\u2019 overreliance in personnel selection, particularly the impact of decision-makers\u2019 information search behavior on selection quality. Findings: Our study revealed decision-makers\u2019 tendency towards status quo bias when using an AI-based ranking system, meaning that they paid more attention to applicants that were ranked higher than those ranked lower. We identified three information search strategies that have different effects on selection quality: (1) homogeneous search coverage, (2) heterogeneous search coverage, and (3) no information search. The more applicants were searched equally often (i.e. homogeneous) as when certain applicants received more search views than others (i.e. heterogeneous) the higher the search intensity was, resulting in higher selection quality. No information search is characterized by low search intensity and low selection quality. Priming decision-makers towards carrying responsibility for their decisions or explaining potential AI shortcomings had no moderating effect on the relationship between search coverage and selection quality. Originality/value: Our study highlights the presence of status quo bias in personnel selection given AI-based applicant rankings, emphasizing the danger that decision-makers over-rely on AI-based recommendations. \u00a9 2024, Christine Dagmar Malin, J\u00fcrgen Flei\u00df, Isabella Seeber, Bettina Kubicek, Cordula Kupfer and Stefan Thalmann.",

Our research illustrates the efficacy of Deep Learning models in generating correct predictions by using a thorough approach including data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, ethical concerns, and interpretability. According to Human Capital Theory, one of the most important results is that one's level of experience matters when making forecasts about one's performance. Responsible AI adoption in HR practices is grounded on issues of ethics, such as the prevention of prejudice and the protection of individuals' personal information. We highlight the need of real-time feedback loops, transfer learning, effective human-AI cooperation, and improved explainability of models in future approaches. Collectively, these methods pave the way for HR decisions that are better for the company as a whole and its employees in terms of both ethics and flexibility. \u00a9 2024 IEEE.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: With the recent proliferation of AI, organisations are transforming not only their organisational design but also the input and output operational processes of the hiring process. The purpose of this paper is to explore the organisational and operational dimensions resulting from the deployment of AI during talent acquisition process. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted semi-structured interviews and meetings with human resources (HRs) professionals, recruiters and AI hiring platform providers in Sweden. Using an inductive data analysis rooted in the principles of grounded theory, the study uncovered four aggregate dimensions critical to understanding the role of AI in talent acquisition. Findings: With insights from algorithmic management and ambidexterity theory, the study presents a comprehensive theoretical framework that highlights four aggregate dimensions describing AI\u2019s transformative role in talent recruitment. The results provide a cautionary perspective, advising against an excessive emphasis on operational performance driven solely by algorithmic management. Research limitations/implications: The study is limited in scope and subject to several constraints. Firstly, the sample size and diversity are restricted, as the findings are based on a limited number of semi-structured interviews and meetings with HRs professionals, recruiters, and AI hiring platform providers. Secondly, the rapid evolution of AI technologies means that the study\u2019s findings may quickly become outdated as new advancements and applications emerge. Practical implications: The results provide managers with actionable information that can lead to more precise and strategic management practices, ultimately contributing to improved organizational performance and outcomes. Plus, enhancing their ability to make informed decisions, optimize processes and address challenges effectively. Social implications: The results signal both positive and negative impacts on employment opportunities. On the positive side, AI can streamline recruitment processes, making it easier for qualified candidates to be identified and hired quickly. However, AI systems can also perpetuate existing biases present in the data they are trained on, leading to unfair hiring practices where certain groups are systematically disadvantaged. Originality/value: By examining the balance between transactional efficiency and relational engagement, the research addresses a crucial trade-off that organizations face when implementing AI in recruitment. The originality lies in its critique of the prevailing emphasis on e-recruiting. \u00a9 2024, Dhyana Paramita, Simon Okwir and Cali Nuur.",

In ranking-related problems, such as in online advertising, recommender systems, and HR automation, much work on fairness remains to be done. Two complications arise: first, the protected attribute may not be available in many applications. Second, there are multiple measures of fairness of rankings, and optimization-based methods utilizing a single measure of fairness of rankings may produce rankings that are unfair with respect to other measures. In this work, we propose a randomized method for post-processing rankings, which do not require the availability of the protected attribute. In an extensive numerical study, we show the robustness of our methods with respect to P-Fairness and effectiveness with respect to Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) from the baseline ranking, improving on previously proposed methods. \u00a9 2024 IEEE.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to investigate the relationships between artificial intelligence in human resources (HR), technology competence, and HR system strength within organizations. Employing a cross-sectional methodology, survey data were collected from 272 employees working in HR departments in the private sector of Saudi Arabia. Partial least squares structural equation modeling was utilized for analysis to evaluate these relationships. The results indicate a significant positive relationship between artificial intelligence in HR and both technology competence (\u03b2 = 0.444, p < 0.001) and HR system strength (\u03b2 = 0.539, p < 0.001). Additionally, there is a positive impact of technology competence on HR system strength (\u03b2 = 0.272, p = 0.021). These findings underscore the importance of investing in AI technologies and enhancing employees\u2019 technological skills to improve HR system effectiveness. Furthermore, the study emphasizes the necessity for organizations to prioritize agility and adaptability in HR strategies while addressing ethical and social considerations surrounding AI in HR practices. Moreover, the study elucidates the role of artificial intelligence in fostering innovation and sustainability within HR practices, contributing to organizational resilience and competitiveness. \u00a9 Sura Al-Ayed, 2024.",

This could involve introducing demographic data into the recommendation process or using more advanced machine learning techniques to eliminate bias. The findings can be used to inform future improvements to the job recommendation service, making it more effective for users and promoting more equitable hiring practices. By improving the job recommendation system, LinkedIn can provide greater value to its users and support the growth of professional networks and job opportunities. \u00a9 2024 IEEE.",

Recognized as a double-edged tool, AI has brought both positive and negative outcomes to organisations and employees. With its increasing popularity in the workplace and our daily practice, how to use AI intelligently and responsibly has become a top concern raised by both academics and practitioners. In this article, we discuss the desired and unintended consequences of AI as documented in current literature, examine the ethical concerns, and identify current solutions. We propose \u2018keeping HRD in the loop\u2019 as a means to addressing ethical challenges associated with AI and offer a new conceptual framework as a tool for reference. Integrating general AI principles and ethical guidelines developed by the Academy of HRD, we map out an ethical boundary consisting of nine human-centred principles and suggest a sample of six HRD interventions that can facilitate responsible AI practices and productive human-machine interfaces. By bringing HRD perspectives into the domain of AI practice, we hope to bring ethical considerations to the forefront of AI decision-making and stimulate more interest in interdisciplinary research and academic-industry collaboration. \u00a9 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

These serious ethical challenges were identified through a process of study developed along multiple lines, including one systematic literature review and in-depth interviews with 40 industry experts as well as technical audits of 10 HR deep learning tools. Other key issues identified are algorithmic biases, with gender bias the most prevalent. Thirty and 40 times were worried about transparency in decision-making. Data privacy concerns came up, too. A legal compliance assessment against the tools with General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other relevant standards showed a 60% partial rate of non-compliance, mainly caused by inadequate data processing or storage. A pilot with five organizations carrying out the recommended strategies for these challenges resulted in a 20% rise in bias mitigation, and an increase of about 15% in compliance with legal standards and ethical norms. These results emphasize the importance of ethical oversight and strong governance in deep learning HR applications, safeguarding against possible negative impacts while making full use of its advantages. \u00a9 2024 IEEE.",

In a time when artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing banking processes, it is critical to comprehend the elements that lead to cognitive dissonance among employees. The study takes a multimodal approach, integrating quantitative techniques to investigate the complex interactions between factors that affect cognitive dissonance in the workplace. Data were gathered from 344 bank employees via online questionnaires. The influence of AI -driven changes on job positions, workplace relationships, and employee expectations is examined in this study. It examines how individuals' flexibility, organizational culture changes, and communication gaps affect their capacity to align their views with the quickly changing technology world. The study also looks at the ethical implications of using AI in banking organizations, taking into account how moral issues might make employees feel more cognitively disoriented. The purpose of this study's findings is to offer useful information to human resource specialists, policymakers, and stakeholders in the banking sector who are attempting to manage the difficulties caused by cognitive dissonance while integrating AI. This research helps to design solutions that promote employee well-being, adaptation, and resilience in the face of revolutionary technology breakthroughs by elucidating the multiple dynamics at play.

Analytically-driven performance management aims to capture and analyze workplace data with advanced analytical techniques to develop a sustainable solution. This systematic literature review (SLR) examines and analyzes frameworks proposed for optimizing engagement and retention through performance analytics. Among the forty initial papers screened, twenty-four highly relevant sources were selected and analyzed. Human resources (HR) related key themes included bias issues, text analysis of reviews, personalized HR management, talent assessments, augmenting HR work with Artificial Intelligence (AI), and integration challenges. According to the findings, a reliable emphasis was placed on the balance of human and machine perspectives. While analytics and algorithms offer insightful information, human judgment is needed to contextualize this data. If datadriven methods are the only ones used, complicated personal aspects that influence experience may be overlooked. Consequently, a human-machine strategy working together is crucial. Furthermore, effective integration requires both strategy alignment and cultural preparedness. Longitudinal evaluations and more real-world case studies help close gaps in the literature. Analytics with human-centric frameworks can maximize engagement and performance management. \u00a9 2024 IEEE.",

This study aims to investigate how artificial intelligence (AI) is currently used in recruiting. A scoping review is a method used to look through the body of existing literature from different databases. Bias, which is otherwise becoming more prevalent in manual recruiting processes, is eliminated in recruitment through automation and analytics. Additionally, in conventional face-to-face interviews, candidates have been found to use impression management strategies. However, the impact of these strategies can be reduced with automated recruiting processes. Virtual interviews powered by AI minimize human bias. Additionally, it makes it easier for recruiters to find talent worldwide. Candidates' opinions of their workplaces and work surroundings are enhanced by stimulation. Using gamified methods, recruiters can determine if a prospect has the necessary work skills. The results and conclusions were practically exact in indicating that the best applications of technology may be found in the field of recruitment, where employing AI is favorable. The hiring process is more effective when AI is used. It minimizes repetitive tasks. The human resources (HR) team benefits from time savings. It is a very new development for HRM to use AI, and very few businesses have done so completely for all HR procedures. The main advantages of using AI will be increased productivity and automated repetitive work; nevertheless, the main challenge that businesses may have is their readiness to adopt innovative technology. \u00a9 2024 IEEE.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has received more scholarly attention over the past few years, evidenced by the increasing volume of literature on AI. However, most of our current knowledge about AI, including its applications, has been derived from studies situated in the context of automation, medicine, and business. This article is a response to acall for expanding AI research to understand its implications for people and their career development. The goal is to provide an updated, holistic understanding of existing research on AI in career development. Through a scoping review of 101 journal publications, this article offered three insights. First, AI has a double-edged sword effect on career development. While AI technology helps streamline career development processes in organisations, it can also disrupt a workplace by causing job insecurity. Secondly, with the unintended consequences, integrating AI into organisational practices can backfire, leading employees to explore alternate careers. Lastly, infusing AI into career development programmes has caused some ethical concerns. With increasing applications of AI, humans are now expected to trust technology-based output, even when such output contradicts their own knowledge and experience. Such blind trust in AI may hinder career progression by providing inaccurate information and advice to the workforce. \u00a9 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

This study contributes to understanding the dilemma whereby the more complex ML becomes, the more its value proposition can be compromised by its opacity. Using a longitudinal dataset on voluntary employee turnover from a German federal agency, we provide evidence for the underlying trade-off between predictive performance and transparency for ML, which has not been found in similar Human Resource Management (HRM) studies using artificially simulated datasets. We then propose measures to mitigate this trade-off by demonstrating the use of post-hoc explanatory methods to extract local (employee-specific) and global (organisation-wide) predictor effects. After that, we discuss their limitations, providing a nuanced perspective on the circumstances under which the use of post-hoc explanatory methods is justified. Namely, when a \u2018transparency-by-design\u2019 approach with traditional linear regression is not sufficient to solve HRM prediction tasks, the translation of complex ML models into human-understandable visualisations is required. As theoretical implications, this paper suggests that we can only fully understand the multi-layered HR phenomena explained to us by real-world data if we incorporate ML-based inductive methods together with traditional deductive methods. \u00a9 2024 The Author(s).

This research employs the TOE (Technology\u2013Organization\u2013Environment) model and incorporates the trust factor to propose a methodology for investigating artificial intelligence (AI) adoption in HRM. A structured questionnaire was used to survey 615 ITeS companies. Data analysis was performed using partial least squares structural equation modelling. The findings of this research indicate that factors such as cost-effectiveness, relative advantage, organization size, top management support, HR readiness, competitive pressure, vendor support, and the trust of HR managers are considered to have a positive impact on AI adoption in managing human resources. The utilization of AI in HRM has been cumbersome by conflicting results stemming from security and privacy concerns and the complexity of the technology involved. It is also found that factors such as reliability and credibility have a positive effect on the trust of HR managers. This article aims to provide valuable insights to senior executives, HR managers, experts, researchers, AI designers, developers, and marketers by strengthening their understanding of the impact of AI in managing human resources. \u00a9 2024 MDI.",

We show that the arguments for using AI technologies to eliminate discrimination in personnel selection depend on presuming specific meanings of the concepts of rationality, bias, fairness, objectivity and AI, which the AI industry and other proponents of AI-based recruitment accept as self-evident. Our critical analysis of the arguments for relying on AI to decrease discrimination in recruitment is informed by insights gleaned from philosophy and methodology of science, legal and political philosophy, and critical discussions on AI, discrimination and recruitment. We scrutinize the role of the research on cognitive biases and implicit bias in justifying these arguments \u2013 a topic overlooked thus far in the debates about practical applications of AI. Furthermore, we argue that the recent use of AI in personnel selection can be understood as the latest trend in the long history of psychometric-based recruitment. This historical continuum has not been fully recognized in current debates either, as they focus mainly on the seemingly novel and disruptive character of AI technologies. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2024.",

Hiring personnel turn to artificial intelligence (AI) tools to help acquire talent, increase efficiency, and reduce costs. Yet despite the best intentions for integrating fair and evidence-based systems, exacerbated levels of bias may occur from using these tools. Drawing from scholarship on process expertise and emerging practices of AI use at work, I provide a case study of 42 high-volume recruiters and uncover how hiring personnel enact and justify unsystematic sourcing practices within the confines of their held expertise, organizational demands, and technology choices. I explain how AI-based hiring decisions in organizations are context dependent and blend the capabilities of algorithmicpowered tools with choices and judgments made by process experts. I conclude by offering theoretical and practical considerations for expertise, hiring, and the integration of algorithms at work. \u00a9 2024, (Ignacio Fernandez Cruz).

This study proposed to examine fundamental aspects of AI in talent acquisition (cost-benefit, opportunities, and risk factors) from the context of strategic analysis and decision-making. 52 respondents from HRM and the information technology departments from fifteen large dairy enterprises, each with more than one thousand employees, were included in the focus group discussion. Both departments were included in the focus group discussion as they heavily employ AI in talent acquisition. The opinions were collected in multiple rounds based on the cost, benefit, opportunity, and risk criteria using the analytical hierarchy process, a multi-criteria decision-making framework. The findings demonstrated that most respondents opinioned AI supports talent acquisition with many opportunities (38.7%) that involve the identification of the best applicants (18.7%) and different benefits (33.2%) to the organization in the form of saving time and cost (16.1%) leading to higher efficacy. The study infers that the application of AI in HRM significantly contributes to talent acquisition, streamlining processes, improving efficiency, and enhancing decision-making. The study recommends that implementing AI in talent acquisition requires a strategic approach, and organizations need to consider factors such as data privacy, ethical use of AI, and ongoing training to ensure successful integration into their hiring processes. Additionally, regular monitoring and adjustments are essential to optimize the effectiveness of AI tools in talent acquisition. \u00a9 Sania Khan, Shaha Faisal, George Thomas, 2024.",

However, the complex nature of the digital environment coupled with the unregulated nature of the coaching profession pose a significant risk for ethical mismanagement. This paper discusses the potential ethical risks in digital and AI coaching that can arise from the (non)human coach, the client, a third party, or the (digital) coaching context. Derived from this, the need for coach training and supervision as well as a sound coach selection based on ethical competencies is emphasized. In addition, the limitations of AI coaching are addressed, suggesting an integrated approach of AI alongside a human coach. \u00a9 2024 The Author(s).

    "abstract": "Changing technology and the growing demand for workforce intelligence have ushered in a new era of human resource (HR) transformation and have compelled HR professionals to continually ideate, innovate, and adapt. This book covers the changing role of HR in the transformation of workplaces to be successful globally. With challenges come new opportunities for HR to completely transform. Currently, technology is considered to be an extension of human beings rather than an external component, which makes people less socially connected. Physical, psychological, and financial well-being in this machine-led world is driving the agenda of HR. Individuals with complex business requirements and long-term goals must coexist with the gig economy, flexible workplaces, and changing priorities. This book precisely addresses these issues. More innovations are needed to create solutions for an ever-growing digital world. This book, therefore, explains how the role of HR executives must be to understand how emerging technologies are affecting company culture, strategy, operational plans, and the hiring of future talent. Crafting a career path for knowledge workers with challenging roles with fulfilling job aspects remains a puzzle. Keeping people engaged and happier is one of the major challenges that HR professionals experience. Different generations in the workplace with differing styles of learning, communication, and dynamic expectations add to these challenges. HR functions must keep evolving to overcome these challenges to transform the workplace, and it is essential to recognize how HR can act as a strategic business advisor through the effective use of technology. This book provides practical advice in these areas. In addition, this book helps professionals, researchers, and practitioners understand the way advanced technology and automation are influencing HR practices and processes in the new normal. The topics are designed to capture the most advanced technology-based HR practices for workplace transformations in industry and academia. This book assembles contributions from experts in HR planning, human capital management, business analytics, people analytics, predictive analysis, and automation from across the world, contributing their knowledge to identify the different attributes of the above-mentioned field of study. The book\u2019s chapters are designed and organized pragmatically to enhance the reader\u2019s experience and interest, reflecting upon a few untouched segments in the HR domain such as HR data privacy, data security, diversity, and inclusion using explainable AI (XAI), blockchain, and metaverse. \u00a9 2024 selection and editorial matter, Anamika Pandey, Simon Grima, Suruchi Pandey & Balamurugan Balusamy.",

Amping up the advantages of being strategic about compensation are advances in technology such as cloud computing and storage along with digitized big data that make the sheer amount of information available and analyzed electronically, a huge competitive opportunity. The good news is these advances have unleashed a tsunami of technology solutions that promise to solve all compensation challenges. In this paper, I synthesize and summarize the literature on artificial intelligence and compensation management and describe four key challenges that companies face in using AI to manage compensation strategically. The first challenge is when and how to use AI to automate and augment compensation tasks and decisions. The second challenge is how to use AI effectively to improve fairness and equity in compensation practices. The third challenge is explaining how AI recommended changes in compensation practices are derived. The fourth challenge is how to actually be strategic using AI solutions. In describing these four challenges, I identify issues, opportunities, gaps, and current limitations of existing AI applications in supporting the strategic management of compensation in organizations. \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Inc.",

As a result, the primary purposes of this paper were to review the major ethical and moral issues associated with using AI and ML for human resource management. In particular, we considered the potential for these new systems to violate ethical standards, and reviewed the degree to which AL and ML models affect (a) perceptions of invasion of privacy, (b) biases and unfair discrimination in employment decision making, and (c) the harm that may come to individuals and organizations from the erroneous data generated by AI and ML. We also offered strategies that organizations might use to overcome these critical ethical problems. \u00a9 2024",

    "abstract": "In recent years, both private and public organizations across contexts have begun implementing AI technologies in their recruitment processes. This transition is typically justified by improved efficiency as well as more objective, performance-based ranking, and inclusive selection of job candidates. However, this rapid development has also raised concerns that the use of these emerging technologies will instead increase discrimination or enhance the already existing inequality. In the present study, we first develop the concept of meta-algorithmic judgment to understand how recruiting managers may respond to automation of the hiring process. Second, we draw on this concept in the empirical assessment of the actual consequences of this type of transition by drawing on two large and unique datasets on employment records and job applications from one of Sweden's largest food retail companies. By comparing the outcomes of traditional and algorithmic job recruitment during this technological transition, we find that, contrary to the company's intentions, algorithmic recruitment decreases diversity. However, in contrast to what is often assumed, this is primarily not because the algorithms are biased, but because of what we identify as an unintended human\u2013algorithmic interaction effect. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2024.",

    "abstract": "One of the most popular applications of artificial intelligence algorithms is in recommendation systems (RS). These take advantage of large amounts of user data to learn from the past to help us identify patterns, segment user profiles, predict users\u2019 behaviors and preferences. The algorithmic architecture of RS has been so successful that it has been co-opted in many contexts, from human resources teams, trying to select top candidates, to medical researchers, wanting to identify drug targets. Although the increasing use of AI can provide great benefits, it represents a shift in our interaction with data and machines that also entails fundamental social threats. These can derive from technological or implementation mistakes but also from profound changes in decision-making. Here, we overview some of those risks including ethical and privacy challenges from a technical perspective. We discuss two particularly relevant cases: (1) RS that fail to work as intended and its possible unwanted consequences; (2) RS that work but at the possible expense of threats to individuals and even to democratic societies. Finally, we propose a way forward through a simple checklist that can be used to improve the transparency and accountability of AI algorithms. \u00a9 2024, The Author(s).",

    "abstract": "As Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology becomes more prevalent in professional occupations, it\u2019s vital to comprehend the elements that shape how these workers interact with and trust AI systems. This study delves into how attributes resembling both the system and humans influence the way office workers view and interact with AI enabled workplace applications (AI-EWAs). Using Uncertainty Reduction Theory (URT), the Computer as Social Actors (CASA) model, and considering the Uncanny Valley Effect (UVE), we investigate how these system-like and human-like traits affect user experiences and trust among office workers. URT highlights how system-like features in AI reduce uncertainty for office workers, enhancing their understanding, decision-making, and data management. This fosters trust and reduces uncertainty. Concurrently, the UVE warns that as AI becomes more human-like, it can reach a point of discomfort and reduced trust. Designing AI applications requires careful balance to avoid triggering this effect. Conversely, the CASA model highlights the importance of human-like attributes, such as personification and social cues, in shaping how office workers perceive and interact with AI applications. CASA suggests that individuals frequently apply the same expectations and social norms from human-to-human interactions (HHI) to human-to-computer communications (HCI). Incorporating human-like traits in AI design fosters familiarity and social connection, promoting engagement, satisfaction, and trust among office workers while avoiding the UVE. By exploring both system-like and human-like features, along with understanding the UVE, this research aims to provide a comprehensive insight into factors that affect trust and interactions with AI-EWAs among office workers. Our findings will inform the design of AI systems that blend traits to enhance user experiences, trust, and acceptance in the workplace. This research offers insights for companies, solution architects, and HR managers implementing AI solutions, considering office workers\u2019 perspectives and the implications of the UVE. \u00a9 2024, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.",

    "abstract": "Automated video interviews powered by artificial intelligence (AI) are increasingly being adopted by employers to screen job candidates despite concerns regarding the humanity and transparency of AI. Accordingly, researchers and practitioners advocate overcoming these concerns by refining AI interfaces in terms of tangibility, immediacy, and transparency. However, AI video interviews featuring different interfaces may impact interviewees' tendencies to engage in impression management behaviors (IMs), which can either improve or impair personnel selection validity. This study addressed calls for research to investigate the issues mentioned above by conducting a field study to explore the ways in which AI and AI interfaces affect candidates' IMs in asynchronous video interviews (AVIs). We developed three AVI interfaces and measured real job applicants' self-reported IMs across four experimental treatments. We found that different AI interfaces could increase or decrease candidates' honest IMs and deceptive IMs in different ways. An exploratory analysis also found that candidates' interview anxiety could be mitigated by an AI interface. \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Inc.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, algorithmic management practices have been widely adopted by employers to monitor remote work, analyse how applicants behave during job interviews, rate worker performance and calculate wage adjustments. As a result, the condition of workers being subjected to the upstream authority of managers has intensified. Employment protection legislation recognizes the importance of curbing the employer\u2019s unilateral discretionary power by deploying several controlling factors. However, the traditional guardrails have now been displaced by the transformative impact of data-driven technologies. As a response to this challenge, several measures implemented by the European Union (EU) could be pragmatically adapted to curtail the expansion of artificial intelligence-based management prerogative. By applying a multidimensional, anticipatory and participatory approach, this paper integrates substantive and procedural rules that contribute to rebalancing informational asymmetries within workplaces and assesses the effectiveness of these rules. Examining case law, administrative decisions and legislative developments, it also discusses the mutually reinforcing relationship between data protection and anti-discrimination measures, which renders automated decisions documentable and contestable. In addition to defensive tactics, this article calls for the involvement of worker representatives in co-designing digital human resource policies. As data are relational, collective bodies are uniquely placed to exchange information, raise awareness and bring claims, with a view to preventing the improper use of algorithms. \u00a9 2024 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands",

Upon evaluating a job seeker\u2019s suitability for a position, participants viewed algorithmic decisions as fairer, more competent, more trustworthy, and more useful than those made by humans. Interestingly, when a candidate was deemed unsuitable for hiring, people reacted more negatively to the verdict given by a human than to the same judgment offered by AI.

We explore this phenomenon in the context of decision-making algorithms by conducting two online studies (N = 1001) where subjects were asked to either create or evaluate an AI-based tool that can automate human resource decisions in an organization. Study 1 revealed that individuals in the role of inventor perceived a low-performing algorithm they created as fairer relative to the ratings of other stakeholders (CEOs, employees, and the general public). The tendency for these \u201cinventors\u201d to personally identify with the products they created mediated this effect. Study 2 showed that inventors\u2019 perceptions of fairness of the algorithms they created translated into an increased desire for the organization to continue using their product, even though it was inaccurate for a third of all decisions.

To investigate how potential social bias in a recommendation outcome influences trust, fairness perceptions, and moral judgement, we used a moral dilemma scenario. Participants (N = 215) imagined being human resource managers responsible for personnel selection and receiving decision-support from either human colleagues or an algorithm-based system. They received an applicant preselection that was either gender-balanced or predominantly male. Although participants perceived algorithm-based support as less biased, they also perceived it as generally less fair and had less trust in it. This could be related to the finding that participants perceived algorithm-based systems as more consistent but also as less likely to uphold moral standards. Moreover, participants tended to reject algorithm-based preselection more often than human-based and were more likely to use utilitarian judgements when accepting it, which may indicate different underlying moral judgement processes. \u00a9 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis.",

While Study 1 was based on a hypothetical scenario, participants in pre-registered Study 2 volunteered to participate in a qualifying session for an attractively remunerated product test, thus competing for real incentives. In both studies, participants in the human condition reported higher levels of trust and acceptance. Providing explanations also positively influenced trust, acceptance, and perceived transparency in Study 1, while it did not exert any effect in Study 2. Type of the selection test affected fairness ratings, with higher ratings for tests requiring human vs. mechanical skills for evaluation.

Procedures were applied to field data in an applied demonstration of an attrition model with disparate impact. Model revisions resulted in adverse impact reductions while simultaneously maintaining model validity. Collectively, this paper provides timely attention to important aspects of the people analytics, turnover and legal domains. \u00a9 2021 John Wiley\u00a0& Sons Ltd.",

A comprehensive search of relevant literature was conducted on Google Scholar. Papers were screened and qualitatively analyzed to identify key themes. Common bias detection approaches include demographic parity testing, calibration, and natural language processing. Fairness in HR processes can be enhanced through anonymization, skill-focused modeling, and addressing biases across the employee lifecycle. Integrated frameworks show promise if evaluated in real-world contexts. However, challenges exist regarding explainability and obtaining meaningful consent to achieve transparency. The strategic application of reviewed techniques could help organizations responsibly leverage HR analytics to maximize benefits while ensuring dignified treatment. Context-specific solutions also need evaluation through case studies and stakeholder input. This review consolidates knowledge on addressing algorithmic bias and lack of transparency concerns in HR analytics. It identifies research gaps in implementations and underrepresented perspectives to advance the responsible and ethical use of data-driven talent management. \u00a9 2024 IEEE.",

    "abstract": "Employee capability is a critical factor that affects the organization's performance. However, many organizations find it challenging to analyze due to its complexity. This paper aims to analyze employee capability using sentiment analysis and machine learning algorithms. To extract and classify those hidden capabilities from employee social media data, sentiment analysis examines employee comments on the social media platform 'X' by identifying words and emotions that are frequently used. Five Machine learning (ML) algorithms are employed: the Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier, Random Forrest Classifier, Extra-Trees Classifier, Gradient Boosting Classifier, and Support Vector Classifier. The Machine Learning algorithms' performance in accurately classifying the sentiment is evaluated based on precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy. The results reveal that the Random Forest Classifier and Extra-Trees Classifier exhibit superior performance in accurately classifying sentiments within the text data, achieving high precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy scores of 90% and 92%, respectively. In contrast, the Gradient Boosting Classifier demonstrates relatively lower performance. This study contributes to the existing literature by applying artificial intelligence tools to analyze employee capabilities, which provides insights and makes informed decisions about employees and enhances hiring process. The study presents opportunities for further research using machine learning and natural language processing techniques to analyze the employee capabilities and therefore enhance hiring procedures. The study also highlights the need for capabilities frameworks to address specific issues that require further investigation. Furthermore, it is essential to develop comprehensive ethical frameworks and guidelines that address informed consent, data privacy, fairness, and bias mitigation. \u00a9 2024 IEEE.",

    "abstract": "The incorporation of Artificial Intelligence (also known as AI) into workforce management is transforming traditional employee engagement tactics by providing creative ways to increase worker participation. This chapter investigates AIenhanced worker involvement techniques, specifically how AI technology might be used to boost employee engagement, contentment, and productivity. Organisations may build increasingly flexible and adaptable work environments by implementing AI-driven analytics, customised feedback systems as a whole and intelligent automation. This chapter looks at how AI can provide real-time insights on employee behaviours and preferences, allowing for tailored interventions that promote a more engaged and inspired workforce. Furthermore, the ethical implications and obstacles of implementing AI in engagement among workers are examined, with a focus on openness and fairness. AI has already given some meaning at workforce, as: Automation is a key function of artificial intelligence. It handles tedious and time-consuming activities, freeing free human workers to concentrate on highly innovative and tactical responsibilities. This not only increases productivity but also lowers the likelihood of errors. AI analyses large databases and gives data-driven insights, allowing for better decision-making. This assistance includes anything from projecting trends to optimising resource allocation. Organisations may make more informed decisions by enhancing their human intelligence by AI-driven insights.This chapter highlights the usefulness of AI-enhanced tactics in promoting worker involvement and offers strategies for embedding AI into organisational processes using a variety of secondary resources, including book chapters, academic articles,and empirical data. The findings show that when used correctly, AI may considerably increase workforce engagement, resulting in increased organisational efficiency and employee well-being. \u00a9 2025 by IGI Global Scientific Publishing.

    "abstract": "In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are gaining increasing prominence in multiple sectors of society. However, the unregulated insertion and deployment of AI technologies into economy and society due to their multifaceted nature can raise significant human rights concerns. In the employment domain, it is widely claimed that discrimination and diversity bias in human resources recruitment and development processes constitute inherent challenges of AI applications. Hence, in treading a more digitalized pathway, from a human rights perspective it is imperative for AI actors to effectively and timely identify, assess and mitigate existing and potential biases in AI-based systems used in the Human Resources Management context. To this end, law and human rights can and should play a key role in the development and utilization of AI in the employment field towards making AI in employment services work in a rights-respecting way and ensuring that no one is left behind. \u00a9 The Editors and Contributors Severally 2024",

    "abstract": "In this chapter, we discuss the role of empathy in ethical leadership development. Empathy as a social practice deeply relates to ethics. Particularly three ethical concepts including generosity, care, and responsibility have a strong link with empathy in leadership practice. Generosity forms the ethical basis that enables individuals to be open and recognize others\u2019 emotional states, as opposed to being self-centered. Caring about and feeling responsible for others motivates leaders to share others\u2019 emotions and empathize. Concerning empathy as a critical building block of ethical leadership, we introduce two methods for human resource development (HRD) scholars to examine empathy in ethical leadership. One is electroencephalography from a neuroscience perspective. The other is video-based methods with the use of AI-enabled verbal and non-verbal emotion expression analysis. The recent advancement of technology has enabled researchers to investigate neurobiological aspects of empathy and its relationship with ethics. Furthermore, a video-based AI-enabled method can help examine people's interactions with a focus on empathy. Using neurobiological and video-based social cognition approaches, we discuss how leaders can develop empathy that leads to ethical leadership. We conclude the chapter with future research and practice recommendations. \u00a9 The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",

However, uncontrolled, this use can also threaten human well-being (replacement, demotivation, discrimination, dependency, etc.). In this sense, this paper analyzes the ethical risks of using AI in four diversified key business sectors: Human Resources Management, Healthcare, Entertainment and Education. From testimonials in literature, the aim of this exploratory study is to identify first the specific ethical risks for each sector and then to propose recommendations to address these ethical issues. Unethical uses of the data used and produced by AI present a variety of ethical risks that require urgent response. For instance, for the Human Resources Management sector, developing an ethical framework is recommended, promoting transparency and making public funding conditional on meeting strict ethical criteria. In the Healthcare sector, training staff involving ethics committees is suggested, as well as, developing overall guidelines, making reimbursement conditional on ethical compliance and establishing independent ethical evaluation bodies. For the Entertainment sector, recommendations include raising awareness among content creators, involving citizen ethics committees, defining an industry ethics charter and labeling AI-generated works. Finally, for the Education sector, creating AI ethics committees, is proposed requiring transparency from providers, sharing best practices, training students and ensuring access to educational data. Generalizing and systematizing the approach will be the next step in this preliminary analysis. \u00a9 2024 IEEE.",

    "abstract": "Resume ranking algorithms have become a vital tool in modern workforce management, as they help applicants face almost insurmountable odds of ever scoring an interview. Natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms are used to assess a candidate's resume and sort them on the basis with which he/she is compatible with the specific job description. This paper analyses many resume ranking methods with an emphasis on the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and cosine Similarity. All these methods help us refine the ranking system for resumes and, hence, better relevant scores. In addition, Named Entity Recognition (NER) improves the possibility of detecting key entities, including skills and experience, to lead to a better ranking system. This also had the edge case where traditional ranking approaches failed to respond with limited functionality as they were limited to shallow keyword matching and provided only a summary of candidates' profiles. It addresses the problem of resume ranking competition and presents three other critical issues: bias, transparency and data privacy. Finally, it evaluates the ability of the system to detect and track against conventional methods. It also sets a path for future research in the field of business and to find out how efficient these resume screening automated systems. \u00a9 2024 IEEE.",

This spillover is tracked across the factual, jurisprudential and legislative dimensions. The chapter begins by dissecting the tools and practices adopted to engage, dispatch, manage, control and assess people who perform platform work. It then examines the case law and the regulatory instruments addressing AM within and outside the platform economy at EU and national levels. The analysis reveals a significant shift in focus towards data protection, non-discrimination and working conditions for larger workforce segments. Moreover, a normative critique of the emerging fragmented regulatory approach is presented, contending that a comprehensive solution requires the effective implementation of the existing legal framework and the design of AM-specific legislation to close the gaps in the EU and national acquis. \u00a9 The Editors and Contributing Authors Severally 2025.

Organizations are being drawn to AI-human collaborations for making choices and operational tasks performed by advanced technologies. Businesses are learning how to adapt to thrive in constantly changing and shifting business environments. To acquire a competitive edge in the face of increasing global competition, HR practices must integrate AI to become more effective. However, due to its limitation of explaining the output produced, there still exist paradoxes around the implementation of AI in the HR area. On the one hand, organizations are leaning towards implementing AI because of its efficacy; on the other hand, some people are opposed to AI because they worry about losing their jobs, biased decision-making, and ethical issues. After all, decision outcomes are not always interpreted. The following chapter aims to explore challenges and opportunities regarding the use of AI in HRM. \u00a9 2024, IGI Global.

The primary research approach used is a literature review. The findings suggest that AI-enabled recruitment has the potential to enhance recruitment quality, increase efficiency, and reduce transactional work. However, algorithmic bias results in discriminatory hiring practices based on gender, race, color, and personality traits. The study indicates that algorithmic bias stems from limited raw data sets and biased algorithm designers. To mitigate this issue, it is recommended to implement technical measures, such as unbiased dataset frameworks and improved algorithmic transparency, as well as management measures like internal corporate ethical governance and external oversight. Employing Grounded Theory, the study conducted survey analysis to collect firsthand data on respondents\u2019 experiences and perceptions of AI-driven recruitment applications and discrimination. \u00a9 2023, Springer Nature Limited.",

    "abstract": "Researchers have investigated whether machine learning (ML) may be able to resolve one of the most fundamental concerns in personnel selection, which is by helping reduce the subgroup differences (and resulting adverse impact) by race and gender in selection procedure scores. This article presents three such investigations. The findings show that the growing practice of making statistical adjustments to (nonlinear) ML algorithms to reduce subgroup differences must create predictive bias (differential prediction) as a mathematical certainty. This may reduce validity and inadvertently penalize high-scoring racial minorities. Similarly, one approach that adjusts the ML input data only slightly reduces the subgroup differences but at the cost of slightly reduced model accuracy. Other emerging tactics involve weighting predictors to balance or find a compromise between the competing goals of reducing subgroup differences while maintaining validity, but they have been limited to two outcomes. The third investigation extends this to three outcomes (e.g., validity, subgroup differences, and cost) and presents an online tool. Collectively, the studies in this article illustrate that ML is unlikely to be able to resolve the issue of adverse impact, but it may assist in finding incremental improvements. \u00a9 2023 The Authors.

However, studies examining applicant reactions to AI have been exclusively vignette-based with no perceived outcome associated with the decision and also have not considered demographic differences in AI evaluator perceptions. We employed an experimental design wherein type of evaluator (AI vs human) and the selection decision (acceptance vs rejection) were manipulated and participants were led to believe they would receive different outcomes based on the selection decision. The results showed more negative interactional justice perceptions for AI evaluators. Further, interaction analyses revealed that being rejected by AI had a negative impact on certain procedural and general justice perceptions. We compared Black and White applicants on these perceptions, finding that the negative impact of being rejected by AI was particularly strong for Black applicants in terms of their general justice perceptions.

    "abstract": "A major problem in employee selection coalesces around convincing decision-makers (e.g., hiring managers) to use analytically derived models. Existing recommendations in the literature largely focus on convincing executives to adopt analytical models and then exert their top-down influence on lower-level hiring decisions. In contrast to these solutions, we explore end user modifiability (i.e., allowing decision-makers to modify a statistical model before use) as a bottom-up approach for increasing hiring managers' implementation of analytical recommendations. From a utility standpoint, we consider how incorporating end user modifiability into hiring decisions will result in a less statistically valid, but potentially more valuable, organizational selection process. We explore these ideas in two studies. In Study 1, we experimentally test whether model modification increases decision-maker reliance on a statistical model, as well as how much decision-makers need to modify a model in order to use it. In Study 2, we examine the extent that modifiability introduces implicit biases that might adversely affect marginalized groups. Results suggest that modifiability can increase decision-makers' perceived usefulness of a model and, importantly, that only a small amount of modifiability is needed to elicit this effect. Further, end user modifications were statistically insignificant predictors of hiring rates across race-based subgroups, though supplementary analyses suggest important cautionary nuance. Given that analytical models are rarely perfectly or wholly implemented, end user modifiability may offer a viable solution for organizations seeking to increase the implementation of algorithmic guidance in selection decisions, even if it deviates modestly from a statistical optimality. \u00a9 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",

In this paper, we take the perspective of job applicants and examine how they perceive the use of algorithms in selection and recruitment. Across four studies on Amazon Mechanical Turk, we show that people in the role of a job applicant perceive algorithm-driven recruitment processes as less fair compared to human only or algorithm-assisted human processes. This effect persists regardless of whether the outcome is favorable to the applicant or not. A potential mechanism underlying algorithm resistance is the belief that algorithms will not be able to recognize their uniqueness as a candidate. Although the use of algorithms has several benefits for organizations such as improved efficiency and bias reduction, our results highlight a potential cost of using them to screen potential employees during recruitment. \u00a9 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",

    "abstract": "Traditional multi-criteria selection methods are the leading approach for selecting a set of candidates when multiple criteria determine selection relevancy. For instance, hiring platforms combine candidates' proximity, skills, and years of experience to build shortlists for recruiters. While these methods succeed in efficiently selecting candidates, their chosen set may unfairly affect marginalized candidate groups (e.g., race or gender). Bridging the gap between traditional fairness-unaware multi-criteria selection and contemporary fairness interventions, we characterize the open problem of fair multi-criteria selection. We design Fair&Share the first efficient fairness-tunable multi-criteria selection method. Fair&Share supports several fair representation notions. The key to Fair&Share is the design of its group-aware utility objective. Fair&Share uses a novel fairness calibration component to provide a user-friendly tuning mechanism for controlling the balance between selection relevancy (utility) and representation fairness. Our fairness-focused selection policy iteratively builds the result set by prioritizing candidates as aiding either the fair representation or the share-d overall utility goals. We prove the optimality of Fair&Share, meaning that Fair&Share selects the best possible candidates such that the desired fair representation is achieved. Our experimental study demonstrates that Fair&Share achieves the best fairness and utility performance of state-of-the-art alternatives adapted to this new problem while taking a fraction of the time. \u00a9 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

    "abstract": "The recruitment process has largely moved online. Job advertisements which used to be bound to newspapers and other print media have become an online service as part of a growing trend towards a more digitalised hiring process. Alongside increased flexibility and cost-cutting, this trend brings so previously unseen challenges. The technology behind online job portals and social media allows job ads to be shown to targeted groups of people using machine learning techniques to filter through the available data and search for the most suitable audience. The correlations that are inferred by algorithms between content and audience, however, can lead to biased outcomes. This is a serious problem since the specific risk with online job ads is that jobseekers who are considered less suitable by the algorithm will not see the ad at all. Such a result effectively hinders access to the labour market and poses the risk of perpetuating existing biases and discrimination. Those discrimination risks raise questions about the legal framework of online job advertisements. This article examines the requirements of the new EU initiatives to regulate artificial intelligence and the digital market and EU non-discrimination law regarding online job advertisements. It also proposes a low-tech solution to the high-tech problems associated with online job advertisements by introducing a legal requirement to publicly tender job ads on an online noticeboard, thus ensuring transparency and effective access to employment. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2023.",

    "abstract": "The growing use of Artificial Intelligence-enabled recruitment systems has become an important component of modern talent recruitment, particularly through social networks such as LinkedIn and Facebook. However, data overflow embedded in recruitment systems, based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods, may result in unconscious gender bias. The purpose of this work is to utilize a set of methods to analyze and detect textual bias in different groups. We analyzed a training dataset of fourteen thousand LinkedIn profiles, which was provided by a company named Talenya, and included job-candidates that fit IT-related positions. We aimed to detect textual self-presentation gender gap patterns, utilizing Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), word2vec and the Universal Sentence Encoder (USE) to code the data, and applied the kernel two-sample test for the purpose of determining whether men's and women's LinkedIn profiles have the same distribution. Additionally, we focused on quantifying and identifying repetition in skills representation in the LinkedIn profile by applying the TF-IDF and cosine similarity tools and compared the repetitiveness pattern of men's and women's profiles. Gender-based analysis was also carried out on smaller, more homogeneous groups of candidates, who share the same position type, geographical location and organizational seniority level. Finally, we provide theoretical and practical implications. \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd",

Although reflecting a likely realization of decision support in high-risk tasks such as personnel selection, trust in hybrid human-automation teams has thus far received limited attention. In two experiments (N<inf>1</inf> = 170, N<inf>2</inf> = 154) we compare trust, trustworthiness, and trusting behavior for different types of decision-support (automated, human, hybrid) across two assessment contexts (personnel selection, bonus payments). We additionally examined a possible trust violation by presenting one group of participants a preselection that included predominantly male candidates, thus reflecting possible unfair bias. Whereas fully-automated decisions were trusted less, results suggest that trust in hybrid decision support was similar to trust in human-only support. Trust violations were not perceived differently based on the type of support. We discuss theoretical (e.g., trust in hybrid support) and practical implications (e.g., keeping humans in the loop to prevent negative reactions). \u00a9 2023 The Authors.

Prior work has examined perceptions of algorithmic fairness and established bias in hiring algorithms, but there is limited work on the ability of computer science students, who are applying for their first computing job, to overcome new barriers posed by automated hiring. To investigate what challenges students face, how they work through them, and their perceptions of these systems, we conducted semi-structured interviews with post-secondary students who were first-time computing job applicants. Analyses revealed that participants had diverse knowledge of hiring algorithms; some people knew to use strategies, such as keywords in resumes, online assessment practice, and referrals to circumvent automated processes to progress to in-person interviews, but others were entirely unaware of the automation. Participants also expressed that current systems prevented them from demonstrating the full extent of their skills and attributed job offers to personal contacts within the company. While some deemed automation a \"necessary evil\"to combat scale, many struggled with the inequity automated hiring processes perpetuated. Understanding student experiences and perspectives with automated hiring has relevance for how current computer science curricula prepares students for the transition to computing jobs post-graduation. Our findings have implications for how to develop new practices to better support students in their transitions amid a changing hiring landscape. \u00a9 2023 ACM.",

With such variation in our views of AI in hiring, we need to understand how these perceptions impact the organizations that use it. In two studies, we investigate how ethical perceptions of using AI in hiring are related to perceptions of organizational attractiveness and innovativeness. Our findings indicate that ethical perceptions of using AI in hiring are positively related to perceptions of organizational attractiveness, both directly and indirectly via perceptions of organizational innovativeness, with variations depending on the type of hiring method used. For instance, we find that individuals who consider it ethical for organizations to use AI in ways often considered to be intrusive to privacy, such as analyzing social media content for traits and characteristics, view such organizations as both more innovative and attractive. Our findings trigger a timely discussion about the critical role of ethical perceptions of AI in hiring on organizational attractiveness and innovativeness. \u00a9 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",

As such, using an ethical lens to study this phenomenon is to better understand whether and how AI matters in hiring. In this paper, we examine whether ethical perceptions of using AI in the hiring process influence individuals\u2019 trust in the organizations that use it. Building on the organizational trust model and the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology, we explore whether ethical perceptions are shaped by individual differences in performance expectancy and social influence and how they, in turn, impact organizational trust. We collected primary data from over 300 individuals who were either active job seekers or who had recent hiring experience to capture perceptions across the full range of hiring methods. Our findings indicate that performance expectancy, but not social influence, impacts the ethical perceptions of AI in hiring, which in turn influence organizational trust. Additional analyses indicate that these findings vary depending on the type of hiring methods AI is used for, as well as on whether participants are job seekers or individuals with hiring experience. Our study offers theoretical and practical implications for ethics in HRM and informs policy implementation about when and how to use AI in hiring methods, especially as it pertains to acting ethically and trustworthily. \u00a9 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",

This paper points out possible positive and negative effects on HRM, workplaces and workers\u2019 organizations along the HR processes and its potential for competitive advantage in regard to managerial decisions on AI implementation regarding augmentation and automation of work. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature review that includes 62 international journals across different disciplines and contains top-tier academic and German practitioner journals was conducted. The literature analysis applies the resource-based view (RBV) as a lens through which to explore AI-driven HRM as a potential source of organizational capabilities. Findings: The analysis shows four ambiguities for AI-driven HRM that might support sustainable company development or might prevent AI application: job design, transparency, performance and data ambiguity. A\u00a0limited scholarly discussion with very few empirical studies can be stated. To date, research has mainly focused on HRM in general, recruiting and HR analytics in particular. Research limitations/implications: The four ambiguities' context-specific potential for capability building in firms is indicated, and research avenues are developed. Originality/value: This paper critically explores AI-driven HRM and structures context-specific potential for capability building along four ambiguities that must be addressed by HRM to strategically contribute to an organization's competitive advantage. \u00a9 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",

An assumption governing such decisions is that there is a property Y such that individual a should be allocated resource R by decision-maker D if a is Y. When there is uncertainty about whether a is Y, algorithms may provide valuable decision support by accurately predicting whether a is Y on the basis of known features of a. Based on recent work on statistical evidence in epistemology this article presents an argument against relying exclusively on algorithmic predictions to allocate resources when they provide purely statistical evidence that a is Y. The article then responds to the objection that any evidence that will increase the proportion of correct decisions should be accepted as the basis for allocations regardless of its epistemic deficiency. Finally, some important practical aspects of the conclusion are considered. \u00a9 2023, The Author(s).",

    "abstract": "ChatGPT and its variants that use generative artificial intelligence (AI) models have rapidly become a focal point in academic and media discussions about their potential benefits and drawbacks across various sectors of the economy, democracy, society, and environment. It remains unclear whether these technologies result in job displacement or creation, or if they merely shift human labour by generating new, potentially trivial or practically irrelevant, information and decisions. According to the CEO of ChatGPT, the potential impact of this new family of AI technology could be as big as \u201cthe printing press\u201d, with significant implications for employment, stakeholder relationships, business models, and academic research, and its full consequences are largely undiscovered and uncertain. The introduction of more advanced and potent generative AI tools in the AI market, following the launch of ChatGPT, has ramped up the \u201cAI arms race\u201d, creating continuing uncertainty for workers, expanding their business applications, while heightening risks related to well-being, bias, misinformation, context insensitivity, privacy issues, ethical dilemmas, and security. Given these developments, this perspectives editorial offers a collection of perspectives and research pathways to extend HRM scholarship in the realm of generative AI. In doing so, the discussion synthesizes the literature on AI and generative AI, connecting it to various aspects of HRM processes, practices, relationships, and outcomes, thereby contributing to shaping the future of HRM research. \u00a9 2023 The Authors.

    "abstract": "With increasingly digitalized workplaces, the potential for sophisticated analyses of employee data rises. This increases the relevance of people analytics (PA), which are tools for the behavioral analysis of employees. Despite this potential, the successful usage of PA is hindered by employee concerns. Especially in Europe, where the GDPR or equivalent laws apply, employee consent is required before data can be processed in PA. Therefore, PA can only provide relevant insights if employees are willing to share their data. One potential way of achieving this is the use of appeal strategies. In the design of PA, the core strategy that can be used is the inclusion of data owner benefits, such as automated feedback, that are given to employees in exchange for sharing their own data. In this paper, we examine benefits as an appeal strategy and develop four design principles for the inclusion of benefits in PA. Then, we describe an exemplary set of analyses and benefits, demonstrating how our principles may be put into practice. Based on this exemplary implementation, we describe and discuss the results of a user study (n = 46) among employees in the EU and UK. Our study investigates the factors that foster or hinder employees' consent to sharing their data with PA. Then, we introduce our data owner benefits and analyze whether they can positively influence this consent decision. Our introduced data owner benefits were, contrary to our expectations, not suited to motivate our participants to consent to sharing their data. We therefore analyze how participants judge the benefits. Participants generally appreciate having them, confirming the value of including data owner benefits when designing PA. Some of our introduced benefits negatively influenced participants' sharing decision, though, meaning that careful consideration of potential risks is required when conceptualizing them. \u00a9 2023 ACM.",

There are various forms of AI-based video interviews with and without the features of tangibility, immediacy, and transparency used for preemployment screening, and these features may distinctively influence applicants' trust in the technology and whether they engage in or disengage from the hiring process accordingly. This field study involved designing a test of the effect of various forms of AI-based video interviews on interviewees' cognitive and affective trust based on the self-reporting of 152 real job applicants. The study found that AI used in asynchronous video interviews (AI-AVI) increased applicants' cognitive trust from that in the non-AI condition. Moreover, when the AI-AVI had features of tangibility and transparency, the applicants\u2019 cognitive and affective trust increased. However, the feature of immediacy did not have a statistically significant impact. Contrary to concern over the potential negative effects caused by AI and its features, no statistically significant impacts were found in this study. \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd",

However, insights regarding trust in automated systems predominantly stem from contexts where the main driver of trust is that systems produce accurate outputs (e.g., alarm systems for monitoring tasks). It remains unclear whether what we know about trust in automated systems translates to application contexts where ethical considerations (e.g., fairness) are crucial in trust development. In personnel selection, as a sample context where ethical considerations are important, we investigate trust processes in light of a trust violation relating to unfair bias and a trust repair intervention. Specifically, participants evaluated preselection outcomes (i.e., sets of preselected applicants) by either a human or an automated system across twelve selection tasks. We additionally varied information regarding imperfection of the human and automated system. In task rounds five through eight, the preselected applicants were predominantly male, thus constituting a trust violation due to potential unfair bias. Before task round nine, participants received an excuse for the biased preselection (i.e., a trust repair intervention). The results of the online study showed that participants have initially less trust in automated systems. Furthermore, the trust violation and the trust repair intervention had weaker effects for the automated system. Those effects were partly stronger when highlighting system imperfection. We conclude that insights from classical areas of automation only partially translate to the many emerging application contexts of such systems where ethical considerations are central to trust processes. \u00a9 2022, The Author(s).",

    "abstract": "The practices of organizational talent acquisition are rapidly transforming as a result of the proliferation of information systems that support decision-making, ranging from applicant tracking systems to recruitment chatbots. As part of human resource management (HRM), talent acquisition covers recruitment and team-assembly activities and is allegedly in dire need for digital aid. We analyze the pitfalls and tensions of digitalization in this area through a lens that builds on the interdisciplinary literature related to digital ethics. Using three relevant landmark papers, we analyzed qualitative data from 47 interviews of HRM professionals in Finland, including team-assembly facilitators and recruitment experts. The analysis highlights 14 potential tensions and pitfalls, such as the tension between requesting detailed data versus respecting privacy and the pitfall of unequal treatment across application channels. We identify that the values of autonomy, fairness and utility are often especially at risk of being compromised. We discuss the tendency of the binary considerations related to human and automated decision making, and the reasons for the incompatibility between current digital systems and organizations' needs for talent acquisition. \u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

    "abstract": "Gender imbalances in the labor market continue to be an economic and social problem that could be reduced by artificial intelligence (AI), which is being promoted as a means for fairer and less biased hiring practices. To examine whether these supposed benefits of AI are perceived as such, we have investigated the preferences of individuals, particularly women, for an AI-based evaluation process in a competitive situation. The results of our experimental study (N = 152) show that individuals generally prefer a human evaluator over an AI evaluator\u2014but only if the human evaluator is female. Whereas we demonstrate that women's beliefs in AI to reduce bias and perceived personal discrimination have a positive direct effect, we find no direct effect of the competitors' gender on women's preference for an AI evaluation. However, we find that the belief in AI moderates the other two relationships, which highlights the crucial role of people's general perception of AI tools in realizing AI's full potential and reduce anticipated biases. Our findings provide an initial indication that the use of AI technology in hiring could encourage women to apply for jobs in male-dominated fields and serve as a starting point for future research in this field. \u00a9 2023",

The aim is to compare whether workers would feel comfortable dealing with a case of harassment at work with an AI system, or whether they prefer to deal with people. This is a pioneering study, unanswered in the literature. A questionnaire has been applied and a sample of 329 workers was obtained, from which it has been possible to conclude, that in cases where there is a good working environment, they feel more comfortable talking to people than to robots, and vice versa when the working environment is bad. Moreover, it is concluded that when workers trust their human resources (HR) departments, they prefer to deal with people regarding a problem such as bullying and that when they trust AI systems, there is a greater preference to interact with robots than when they do not trust them. \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Inc.",

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to reduce operational costs, increase efficiency, and improve customer experience. Thus, it is crucial to forming project teams in an organization, in such a way that they will welcome AI in the decision-making process. The current technological revolution is demanding a rapid pace of change to companies and has increased the attention to the role of teams in fostering innovation adoption. We propose an innovative multicriteria model based on the goal programming approach for solving the optimal allocation of individuals to different groups. The model copes with human resources' cost and human-machine trust. Indeed, we propose an aggregated measure of the attitude towards AI tools to be employed to support tasks in an organization: more precisely our index is based on three dimensions: technology acceptance, technology self-efficacy, and source credibility. By incorporating this index in a team formation model, each team can be guaranteed to have less resistance to change in adopting machine-based decisions, a scenario that will characterize the years to come. The proposed index can also be integrated into more complex and comprehensive models to support business transformation. \u00a9 1988-2012 IEEE.",

The values laden in technology play a significant role in its societal impact.We conducted qualitative content analysis on the public-facing websites (N=229) of EAI hiring services. We identify the organizational problems that EAI hiring services claim to solve and reveal the values emerging in desired EAI uses as promoted by EAI hiring services to solve organizational problems. Our findings show that EAI hiring services market their technologies as technosolutions to three purported organizational hiring problems: 1) hiring (in)accuracy, 2) hiring (mis)fit, and 3) hiring (in)authenticity. We unpack these problems to expose how these desired uses of EAI are legitimized by the corporate ideals of data-driven decision making, continuous improvement, precision, loyalty, and stability. We identify the unfair and deceptive mechanisms by which EAI hiring services claim to solve the purported organizational hiring problems, suggesting that they unfairly exclude and exploit job candidates through EAI's creation, extraction, and affective commodification of a candidate's affective value through pseudoscientific approaches. Lastly, we interrogate EAI hiring service claims to reveal the core values that underpin their stated desired use: techno-omnipresence, techno-omnipotence, and techno-omniscience. We show how EAI hiring services position desired use of their technology as a moral imperative for hiring organizations with supreme capabilities to solve organizational hiring problems, then discuss implications for fairness, ethics, and policy in EAI-enabled hiring within the US policy landscape. \u00a9 2023 Owner/Author.",

While analysis found that AI technologies like machine learning (ML), natural language processing (NLP), machine vision and recommendation systems are being used in HRM functions for distinctive uses. Analysis of the literature also revealed that automation, cost optimisation, and technological development acts as enablers for AI incorporation in HRM domain. Lack of skills, unrealistic standards, privacy and security, and job obsolescence are the factors that act as hindrances during adoption of AI-systems in HRM.

    "abstract": "Despite the increasing popularity of AI-supported selection tools, knowledge about the actions that can be taken by organizations to increase AI acceptance is still in its infancy, even though multiple studies point out that applicants react negatively to the implementation of AI-supported selection tools. Therefore, this study investigates ways to alter applicant reactions to AI-supported selection. Using a scenario-based between-subject design with participants from the working population (N = 200), we varied the information provided by the organization about the reasons for using an AI-supported selection process (no additional information vs. written information vs. video information) in comparison to a human selection process. Results show that the use of AI without information and with written information decreased perceived fairness, personableness perception, and increased emotional creepiness. In turn, perceived fairness, personableness perceptions, and emotional creepiness mediated the association between an AI-supported selection process, organizational attractiveness, and the intention to further proceed with the selection process. Moreover, results did not differ for applicants who were provided video explanations of the benefits of AI-supported selection tools and those who participated in an actual human selection process.

    "abstract": "Management scholars and practitioners have highlighted the importance of ethical dimensions in the selection of strategies. However, to date, there has been little effort aimed at theoretically understanding the ethical positions of individuals/organizations concerning human resource management (HRM) decision-making processes, the selection of specific ethical positions and strategies, or the post-decision accounting for those decisions. To this end, we present a Throughput model framework that describes individuals' decision-making processes in an algorithmic HRM context. The model depicts how perceptions, judgments, and the use of information affect strategy selection, identifying how diverse strategies may be supported by the employment of certain ethical decision-making algorithmic pathways. In focusing on concerns relating to the impact and acceptance of artificial intelligence (AI) integration in HRM, this research draws insights from multidisciplinary theoretical lenses, such as AI-augmented (HRM(AI)) and HRM(AI) assimilation processes, AI-mediated social exchange, and the judgment and choice literature. We highlight the use of algorithmic ethical positions in the adoption of AI for better HRM outcomes in terms of intelligibility and accountability of AI-generated HRM decision-making, which is often underexplored in existing research, and we propose their key role in HRM strategy selection. \u00a9 2022 The Authors",

While AI has numerous useful applications and can help speed up business processes or transform systems, its use in human resources (HR) processes and systems presents a complex series of ethical considerations that require organizational leaders to tread with caution. In this paper, we argue that as the foremost worker advocates in the firm, HR managers must be ethically sensitive and accountable. They have responsibility to carefully monitor AI programs to ensure that these systems do what they are purported to do and protect the dignity of the worker through transparency regarding the data being collected and privacy regarding its usage. Lastly, the HR manager must closely monitor the fairness and equity impacts of AI such that its use is procedurally and distributivity just. \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Inc.",

    "abstract": "Previous research has shown that algorithmic decisions can reflect gender bias. The increasingly widespread utilization of algorithms in critical decision-making domains (e.g., healthcare or hiring) can thus lead to broad and structural disadvantages for women. However, women often experience bias and discrimination through human decisions and may turn to algorithms in the hope of receiving neutral and objective evaluations. Across three studies (N = 1107), we examine whether women\u2019s receptivity to algorithms is affected by situations in which they believe that their gender identity might disadvantage them in an evaluation process. In Study 1, we establish, in an incentive-compatible online setting, that unemployed women are more likely to choose to have their employment chances evaluated by an algorithm if the alternative is an evaluation by a man rather than a woman. Study 2 generalizes this effect by placing it in a hypothetical hiring context, and Study 3 proposes that relative algorithmic objectivity, i.e., the perceived objectivity of an algorithmic evaluator over and against a human evaluator, is a driver of women\u2019s preferences for evaluations by algorithms as opposed to men. Our work sheds light on how women make sense of algorithms in stereotype-relevant domains and exemplifies the need to provide education for those at risk of being adversely affected by algorithmic decisions. Our results have implications for the ethical management of algorithms in evaluation settings. We advocate for improving algorithmic literacy so that evaluators and evaluatees (e.g., hiring managers and job applicants) can acquire the abilities required to reflect critically on algorithmic decisions. \u00a9 2022, The Author(s).",

In trying to find answers to this question, we take our lead from recent debates about People Analytics and analyze how the use of algorithmically driven digital technologies like facial recognition and drones in work-organizations and societies at large shape the conditions of ethical conduct. Linking the concepts of algorithmic governmentality and space of ethics, we analyze how such technologies come to form part of governing practices in specific contexts. We conclude that datafication and automation have huge implications for human reflexivity and the capacity to enact responsibility in decision making. But that itself does not mean that the space for ethical conduct disappears, which is the impression left in some literatures, but rather that is modified and (re) constituted in the interplay of mechanisms of closure (like automating decision making, black boxing and circumventing reflexivity), and opening (such as disclosing contingent values and interests in processes of problematization, contestation and resistance). We suggest that future research investigates in more detail the dynamics of closure and opening in empirical studies of the use and effects of algorithmically driven digital technologies in organizations and societies. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2022.",

In this article, the author questions the extent to which the legal framework for automated decision-making in the GDPR is attuned to the employment context. More specifically, the author argues that an individual\u2019s right may not be the most appropriate approach to contesting artificial intelligence (AI) based decisions in situations involving dependency contracts, such as employment relationships. Furthermore, Article 22 GDPR derogations rarely apply in the employment context, which puts organizations on the wrong track when deploying AI systems to make decisions about hiring, performance, and termination. In this scenario, emerging initiatives are calling for a shift from an individual rights perspective to a collective governance approach over data as a way to leverage collective bargaining power. Taking inspiration from these different initiatives, I propose \u2018algorithmic co-governance\u2019 to address the lack of accountability and transparency in AI-based employment decisions. Algorithmic co-governance implies giving third parties (ideally, the workforce\u2019s legal representatives) the power to negotiate, correct, and overturn AI-based employment decision tools. In this context, Spain has implemented a law reform requiring that Workers\u2019 Councils are informed about the \u2018parameters, rules, and instructions\u2019 on which algorithmic decision-making is based, becoming the first law in the European Union requiring employers to share information about AI-based decisions with Workers\u2019 Councils.

Interactions between anxiety, gender and performance are explored. Feedback from 4,778 job applicants reveals a Net Promoter score of 58, indicating more applicants support than dislike the assessment, and that games deliver a positive applicant experience in practise.

    "abstract": "Algorithms are becoming increasingly prevalent in the hiring process, as they are used to source, screen, interview, and select job applicants. This chapter examines the perspective of both organisations and policymakers about algorithmic hiring systems, drawing examples from Japan and the United States. The focus is on discussing the drivers underlying the rising demand for algorithmic hiring systems and four risks associated with their implementation: the privacy of job candidate data; the privacy of current and former employees\u2019 workplace data; the potential for algorithmic hiring bias; and concerns surrounding ongoing oversight of algorithmically-assisted decision-making throughout the hiring process. These risks serve as the foundation for developing a risk management framework based on management control principles to facilitate dialogue within organisations to address the governance and management of such risks. The framework also identifies areas policymakers can focus on to help balance (1) granting organisations unfettered access to the personal and potentially sensitive data of job applicants and employees to develop hiring algorithms and (2) implementing strict data protection laws that safeguard individuals\u2019 rights yet may impede innovation, and emphasises the need to establish an intra-governmental AI oversight and coordination function that tracks, analyses, and reports on adverse algorithmic incidents. The chapter concludes by highlighting seven recommendations to mitigate the risks organisations and policymakers face in the development, use, and oversight of algorithmic hiring. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2023.",

    "abstract": "This research aims to provide insights into the intersection of technology, objectivity, and cultural values in the context of employee performance evaluation and management, enriching our understanding of cultural values and phenomena in the contemporary world. In today's globalized world, decision-making processes require objectivity and fairness. This research focuses on employee performance evaluation and management, proposing a fuzzy logic-based system to achieve unbiased assessment. The system is designed to align personal and organizational goals, thereby enhancing productivity and job satisfaction. Performance assessment is crucial for managing a company's workforce, with staff evaluations playing a pivotal role in individual development, organizational effectiveness, and business strategy alignment. The proposed system offers an objective assessment of employee performance, fostering a sense of purpose and meaning in work. It determines performance indices through multiple quantitative assessment scenarios, ultimately selecting the best-performing employee based on these indices. This research simplifies the process of performance rating computation for human resource personnel, aiding in the effective management of a company's workforce. Furthermore, it fosters alignment of personal and organizational goals and encourages positive relationships between management and employees. This study has significant implications for contemporary values and cultural phenomena, contributing to the ongoing discourse on the importance of objectivity, fairness, and purpose in managing a company's workforce. Additionally, the research explores the impact of technology and algorithms on employee performance evaluation and its broader implications for organizational culture and values. \u00a9 2023, Cultura.

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) enabled automated employment decision tools (AEDT) used in managing employee recruitment cycle have been shown to be untrustworthy in initial candidate screening and selection. The problem is so widespread that law makers have begun to address it through mitigating policies and new laws. Over the last twenty years, recruitment technologies have naturally progressed from email and online applications/e-forms to filtering via AI in applicant tracking systems to synchronous/asynchronous video interviews that often employs an AI decision agent. While AEDTs have multiple benefits, the increased use of AI enabled services in the recruitment process has decreased recruiters\u2019 trust in the system\u2019s outcomes and increased concern about gender and racial biases. Decreased trust in outcome quality and increased concerns of outcome fairness from AI-driven AEDTs have partly risen out of the lack of understanding (explainability) about how such systems work. Most AI algorithms are black boxes that provide little to no explanation about how candidate lists are generated from thousands of applicants. Transparency in the candidate selection process is an essential component of a fair selection process. Justified fears of highly biased and unfair lists of AI-chosen candidates, coupled with the inability to clearly explain the selection process have left many decision-makers doubting the trustworthiness of these systems and expressing strong hesitations toward full scale adoption and use of AEDT systems, exposing a legitimate obstacle for large scale adoption of such systems. Relying on the Human-Centered AI design framework (Schneiderman, 2020) and explainable AI paradigm (Rai, 2020), we propose that making AEDT systems more explainable leads to increased system trustworthiness which eventually should result in more adoption and use of such systems. In addition, increased explainability would influence perceived fairness of the system outcomes by giving users a means to explain how a decision is made (e.g., how a list is created) and that in turn should increase users' trust in the system. Therefore, Prop1: AI explainability positively affects perceived trustworthiness of an AI system. Prop2: Explainability positively affects perceived fairness of an AI system decisions. Prop3: Perceived AI process fairness positively affects perceived trustworthiness of an AI system. Prop4: Perceived trustworthiness of an AI system positively impacts individuals' intention to adopt. Prop5: Perceived controllability of an AI system positively impacts individuals' intention to adopt. \u00a9 2023 29th Annual Americas Conference on Information Systems, AMCIS 2023.

The incorporation of AI into HR processes is the driving force behind the current revolution. Within the framework of Industry 4.0, this study investigates the far-reaching effects of AI on HR digitization. Our study sheds light on the mutually beneficial interaction between AI and HR processes via the use of rigorous techniques, such as mathematical modelling and ethical issues. The findings confirm a causal link between AI implementation and HR outcomes, highlighting the opportunity to boost effectiveness, talent management, and workforce output. The temporal dynamics also show that this connection is dynamic, which highlights the need of flexible approaches. Predictive models built with machine learning may be used practically to foresee HR results from AI implementation. The ethical implications of AI-driven HR highlight the significance of justice and the elimination of prejudice. This study helps HR experts, company executives, and government officials better understand the evolving environment of AI-driven HR and implement constructive reforms in the field. By highlighting the importance of advanced AI algorithms, ethical considerations, interdisciplinary collaboration, and a human-centred approach, this research points to a path forward that will make AI-driven HR in Industry 4.0 not only efficient but also ethical, equitable, and responsive to the changing needs of today's workforce. \u00a9 2023 IEEE.",

    "abstract": "Human Resource Management Intelligence (HRMI) and sophisticated data analytics are converging to bring about a revolutionary change in HR procedures in today's information age. This study takes an inquisitive trip to the interface between human resources and machine learning, investigating the empirical discoveries and practical applications that reframe HRMI. We explore the complex relationship between HR choices and outcomes like performance and turnover using machine learning models. A convincing narrative is articulated by the study's authors: machine learning methods, ranging from linear regression to random forests, lead a data-driven HR revolution. The results highlight the value of strategic investment in employee development, provide light on the complex dynamics of employee happiness and retention, and explore the ethical elements of HRMI in an age of heightened data scrutiny. Real-world examples illustrate the concepts and provide actionable guidance for HR experts who want to make more informed decisions with the help of data. This study also supports a more comprehensive method of HRMI, one that integrates empirical data analysis with theoretical frameworks. The convergence of AI, ethical AI, and the changing nature of remote labor opens up exciting possibilities for HRMI in the future. This waypoints towards an HRMI field that is not just reactive but also prescient, an area where information serves as the compass leading businesses to improved financial health, more diversity of thought, and a more promising future in the workplace. The research paper reveals the future of HRMI, which is a data-driven frontier where HR experts transform into architects of better work environments, where strategic insights, organizational success, and the well-being of the workforce are all harmoniously balanced. \u00a9 2023 IEEE.",

    "abstract": "The significant effects of artificial intelligence (AI) on human resource management (HRM) and its revolutionary effect on modern corporate practices have been investigated in this empirical study. In the ever-changing business landscape of today, companies are always looking for innovative strategies to improve productivity and competitiveness. Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a key invention that not only penetrates many industries but also transforms human resource management (HRM) by transforming workforce management, performance evaluation, including talent acquisition. The conventional resume screening process has been changed by AI's involvement in talent acquisition, resulting in it being more objective and efficient. Artificial intelligence (AI)-powered algorithms quickly evaluate a large number of resumes, classify applicants, and identify the best ones. AI gives businesses a competitive edge by broadening the talent pool and scanning a variety of sources to help with proactive candidate sourcing. In order to enhance the applicant experience overall, chatbots and virtual assistants communicate with candidates in real time while they do pre-screening interviews. In order to overcome bias issues, predictive analytics assists in assessing individuals' potential and synchronizes recruiting with strategic goals. Artificial intelligence (AI) brings continuous in addition to objective feedback systems to performance evaluation and feedback, minimizing subjectivity and enhancing fairness. Identifying skill gaps makes individualized development strategies possible. AI's data-driven approach to workforce management including optimization helps with staffing requirements predictions, schedule optimization, resource allocation, and proactive employee attrition management. The use of AI in HRM has many advantages, but it also presents difficulties in addition to moral questions, including data privacy, job security, and decision-making responsibility. To overcome these obstacles, organizations are required to set up strong data protection procedures, open lines of communication, as well as distinct accountability structures. This empirical research explores the complex relationship between AI and HRM and provides guidance with regard to how to use AI to support more ethical and effective HR procedures, which will eventually influence corporate practices in the future. \u00a9 2023 IEEE.",

    "abstract": "In the modern digital era, the integration of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) in job recommendation systems offers a transformative approach to bridging candidates with appropriate job opportunities. Traditional job matching techniques, reliant on human evaluation, are often fraught with inefficiencies and inaccuracies, especially given the extensive volume of job seekers and openings. This study introduces an innovative job recommendation methodology that synergistically combines the capabilities of ML and DL models. Our proposed model leverages the adaptability of ML algorithms to process diverse datasets and the power of DL neural networks to discern intricate patterns within vast data troves. Initial findings demonstrate an improved recommendation accuracy and a reduction in the \"cold start\" problem often encountered in recommendation systems. Furthermore, the study addresses fairness concerns, ensuring that proposed model provides equitable suggestions across various demographics. By integrating these cutting-edge technologies, our method not only enhances the job-seeking experience for candidates but also streamlines recruitment processes for employers. The overarching aim is to foster a more efficient, transparent, and inclusive job market. \u00a9 2023 IEEE.",

    "abstract": "Previous research has shown that employees tend to react more positively to corrective feedback from supervisors to the extent they perceive that they were treated with empathy, respect, and concern towards fair interpersonal treatment in receiving the feedback information. Then, to facilitate effective supervisory feedback and coaching, it would be useful for organizations to monitor the contents of feedback exchanges between supervisors and employees to make sure that supervisors are providing performance feedback using languages that are more likely to be perceived as interpersonally fair. Computer-aided text analysis holds potential as a useful tool that organizations can use to efficiently monitor the quality of the feedback messages that supervisors provide to their employees. In the current study, we applied computer-aided text analysis (using closed-vocabulary text analysis) and machine learning to examine the validity of language-based algorithms trained on supervisor language in performance feedback situations for predicting human ratings of feedback interpersonal fairness. Results showed that language-based algorithms predicted feedback interpersonal fairness with reasonable level of accuracy. Our findings provide supportive evidence for the promise of using employee language data for managing (and improving) performance management in organizations. \u00a9 (2023), (Korean Society of Management Information Systems).

    "abstract": "Many intelligent systems depend on black-box services for achieving goals. For example, Decision Support Systems (DSS) incorporate image tagging services for translating the content of an image into useful information that serves the purpose of the system under development (e.g., facilitating hiring decisions). Auditing the results of DSS for fairness can thus become a cumbersome process as they are correlated with the output of the black-box image tagger. In this work, we assume that tags generated by an image tagger are part of the DSS and in terms of fairness can be considered socially acceptable or unacceptable conforming to the varying goals of a DSS. For example, the tag \"good-looking\"can be considered appropriate in a dating context but inappropriate in a hiring context. We propose a methodology for leveraging the use of crowdsourcing as an approach for auditing what is socially acceptable and unacceptable for tags generated by black-box image taggers. As a first step, we attempt to understand how the crowdworkers perceive (un)acceptable tags in two scenarios: (i) a hiring DSS, and (ii) a dating DSS. Through our analysis, we investigate how answers (in our case tags) received by crowdworkers representing different demographic groups (i.e., country of residence and gender) impact the auditing process. Results indicate that varying the DSS scenario, and the demographics of the crowdworkers, yields a different fairness perspective concurrent to the \"acceptable\"and \"unacceptable\"social norms. \u00a9 2023 IEEE.",

These technological advancements are generating significant interest among HR leaders to embrace AI in human resource management (HRM). Researchers and practitioners are keen to investigate the adoption of AI in HRM and the resultant human\u2013machine collaboration. This study investigates HRM specific factors that enable and inhibit the adoption of AI in extended HR ecosystems and adopts a qualitative case research design with an abductive approach. It studies three well-known Indian companies at different stages of AI adoption in HR functions. This research investigates key enablers such as optimistic and collaborative employees, strong digital leadership, reliable HR data, specialized HR partners, and well-rounded AI ethics. The study also examines barriers to adoption: the inability to have a timely pulse check of employees\u2019 emotions, ineffective collaboration of HR employees with digital experts as well as external HR partners, and not embracing AI ethics. This study contributes to the theory by providing a model for AI adoption and proposes additions to the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology in the context of AI adoption in HR ecosystems. The study also contributes to the best-in-class industry HR practices and digital policy formulation to reimagine workplaces, promote harmonious human\u2013AI collaboration, and make workplaces future-ready in the wake of massive digital disruptions. \u00a9 \u00a9 2024 Singh and Pandey.",

The use of advanced machine learning models offers a promising solution to this challenge by providing universities with the ability to efficiently analyse vast amounts of data and identify patterns that can be used to optimize their recruitment and placement strategies. In this paper, we delve into the exciting world of machine learning and explore how it can revolutionize university graduate employability. From predictive models that analyse student performance, interests, and career aspirations to identify the best-fit job opportunities for each student, to machine learning algorithms that match job candidates with suitable job openings based on their skills, experience, and qualifications, the possibilities are endless. It is essential for universities and companies to implement responsible machine learning practices and ensure that their algorithms are fair and unbiased to prevent issues of bias and discrimination. As the job market becomes more competitive and complex, universities and companies must leverage advanced technologies to remain competitive and attract top talent. By embracing machine learning and developing responsible machine learning practices, universities can optimize their recruitment and placement strategies and enhance the employability of their graduates. The use of advanced machine learning models presents an exciting opportunity for universities to optimize their recruitment and placement strategies and revolutionize university graduate employability. \u00a9 2023 IEEE.",

    "abstract": "The introduction of artificial intelligence in all domains of life is the most transformative process in recent history. It is also a highly dynamic process, and due to the pace of technological development, a very limited legal framework is available to address issues of human rights, ethics, transparency, privacy, safety and accountability. During the last few years, artificial intelligence started to reshape employment processes. Positive aspects of the introduction of AI in the employment process are efficiency and quality in job matching, digitalisation and acceleration of the process, ability to process large data and match job seekers to available vacancy announcements, the alleviation of administrative burdens of employees of employment agencies and giving them strategic and innovative roles. All these are indispensable in present times when demographic challenges in European countries are leading to increased labour migrations and require changes in the recruitment process. The paper explores the current challenges of AI, i.e. how to achieve human-centred values and fairness of AI use during the employment process, preventing algorithmic bias and discriminatory application of AI tools. In order to harness the maximum benefits of AI, we need to develop a regulatory framework that would be enforceable, inclusive and adaptive (OECD), particularly knowing that most AI solutions are privately owned and developed for commercial purposes. \u00a9 The Authors.

    "abstract": "The advancement of technology has led to the diffusion of AI, extending beyond individuals to the organizational level. Among all, AI recruitment is increasing organizations' interest in its adoption to enhance operational efficiency, shape an attractive corporate image, and elevate the recruitment experience. However, despite the increasing importance of AI recruitment, most of the previous research is conducted in the context of AI versus Human or AI-human collaboration and there is a lack of research examining how the applicant\u2019s perceptions of organizational justice and attractiveness are formed by the AI recruiter\u2019s human-likeness and situational context. To address this research gap, this study aims to investigate the impact of AI Anthropomorphism on procedural justice, interactional justice, and organizational attractiveness based on the positive/negative outcome in an AI Recruitment setting. This study conducted a scenario-based between-subject experiment involving a 2(Human-like/Machine-like)X2(Positive/Negative) design. An independent sample T-test and ANOVA were conducted to test the hypotheses. The results revealed that people prefer Human-like AI recruiters to machine-like ones in all measured variables. Considering the recruitment\u2019s valence, there were significant differences in perceived interactional Justice and organizational attractiveness only in the negative decision-making situations. However, procedural justice did not differ based on the level of AI anthropomorphism. It showed an outcome bias, which shows that regardless of the AI recruiter\u2019s type, applicants tend to perceive higher procedural justice in positive rather than negative situations. This research offers insights for developers of AI Recruitment solutions and organizations considering the adoption of AI Recruitments, helping them explore optimal strategies for utilizing AI Recruitment system effectively. \u00a9 2023 International Consortium for Electronic Business.

We undertook a field experiment that used AI vis-\u00e0-vis human managers to perform structured, data-intensive evaluations of employee performance. We generate two sets of insights. First, employees considered AI to be both fairer and more accurate in evaluating their performance than the average human manager. Second, to catch up with AI, human managers\u2019 fairness perceived by employees played a first-order role by (a) helping human managers, to a greater extent than those managers\u2019 evaluation accuracy, to close the performance gap of the employees evaluated by them compared with that of those evaluated by AI, and (b) constraining the effect of human managers\u2019 perceived accuracy of evaluations on employees\u2019 performance. Thus, facing the competition from AI, it is all the more important for human managers to treat employees fairly and build positive interpersonal relationships with employees. \u00a9 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: The application of artificial intelligence (AI) can substantially enhance both short- and long-term decision-making in human resource management (HRM) practices. However, academic research fails to address the dark side of AI in confluence with HRM and primarily paints a bright picture of the advantages of AI. Purpose: The current research emphasises the challenges faced in the HRM domain in applying AI in HRM practices and further discusses the future path to maximise the effect of AI on HRM. Methodology: The study rigorously surveyed secondary sources like the journal papers, consultant reports and other databases to critically examine the challenges encountered in applying AI in HRM practices. Findings: Analysis of the above-mentioned sources shows that AI algorithm might bring routinisation of work. HRM ethics, data safety and integrity, biased algorithm from the programmer, fewer data to train the AI model, lack of technical skills of HR executive, neglecting values, and ignoring the creative thinking by employees are a few aspects that might cause difficulty in the adaptation of AI in the HRM domain. As a consequence, there could be unnecessary extra monitoring of employee behaviour, which in turn could lead to loss of workplace well-being and trimming of the human element in HRM. Practical Implications: This study adds value by focusing on the challenges and suggests the path for robust HRM practices; because, the biased decision-making by AI could potentially lead to improper decision-making by the top management, and in turn, the sustainability of a firm could be at stake. \u00a9 2023 by Lalita Mohan Mohapatra, A.

    "abstract": "Introduction: Gender biases in hiring decisions remain an issue in the workplace. Also, current gender balancing techniques are scientifically poorly supported and lead to undesirable results, sometimes even contributing to activating stereotypes. While hiring algorithms could bring a solution, they are still often regarded as tools amplifying human prejudices. In this sense, talent specialists tend to prefer recommendations from experts, while candidates question the fairness of such tools, in particular, due to a lack of information and control over the standardized assessment. However, there is evidence that building algorithms based on data that is gender-blind, like personality - which has been shown to be mostly similar between genders, and is also predictive of performance, could help in reducing gender biases in hiring. The goal of this study was, therefore, to test the adverse impact of a personality-based algorithm across a large array of occupations. Method: The study analyzed 208 predictive models designed for 18 employers. These models were tested on a global sample of 273,293 potential candidates for each respective role. Results: Mean weighted impact ratios of 0.91 (Female-Male) and 0.90 (Male-Female) were observed. We found similar results when analyzing impact ratios for 21 different job categories. Discussion: Our results suggest that personality-based algorithms could help organizations screen candidates in the early stages of the selection process while mitigating the risks of gender discrimination. \u00a9 \u00a9 2023 Kubiak, Efremova, Baron and Frasca.",

It is possible for individuals with protected attributes, such as race, gender, or age, to be subjected to discrimination in the fields of job selection and loan approval. The suggested method utilizes fuzzy clustering in conjunction with the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to rebalance the data set and reduce the amount of bias that is there. Fuzzy clustering is applied to discover groups of similar instances based on specific characteristics, while SMOTE is utilized to construct fake examples in the underrepresented group. Fuzzy clustering is also utilized to locate groups of comparable cases based on certain characteristics. The method is assessed in contrast to other rebalancing strategies that already exist and based on many standard data sets. The findings indicate that the suggested approach outperforms the methods that are state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score metrics, demonstrating its effectiveness in reducing bias in the protected' attributes. \u00a9 2023 IEEE.",

    "abstract": "Automated decision systems are increasingly used to take consequential decisions in problems such as job hiring and loan granting with the hope of replacing subjective human decisions with objective machine learning (ML) algorithms. However, ML-based decision systems are prone to bias, which results in yet unfair decisions. Several notions of fairness have been defined in the literature to capture the different subtleties of this ethical and social concept (e.g., statistical parity, equal opportunity, etc.). Fairness requirements to be satisfied while learning models created several types of tensions among the different notions of fairness and other desirable properties such as privacy and classification accuracy. This paper surveys the commonly used fairness notions and discusses the tensions among them with privacy and accuracy. Different methods to address the fairness-accuracy trade-off (classified into four approaches, namely, pre-processing, in-processing, post-processing, and hybrid) are reviewed. The survey is consolidated with experimental analysis carried out on fairness benchmark datasets to illustrate the relationship between fairness measures and accuracy in real-world scenarios. \u00a9 2023 The Author(s)",

    "abstract": "Introduction: Traditional recruitment system relied heavily on the applicants\u2019 curriculum vitae (CV). This system, besides becoming redundant, has proved to be a futile exercise leading to the hiring of candidates that eventually turn out to be \u2018misfits\u2019. CVs were the only source of candidates\u2019 data available for the recruiters a few years back. Face-to-face interviews was considered to be the ultimate solution for hiring suitable candidates. However, evidence suggests that interview scores and job performances do not complement each other. Advancement in artificial intelligence (AI) has introduced several techniques in the recruitment process. Purpose: This chapter underscores the drawbacks of the traditional recruitment process. Evidence suggests that the traditional recruitment process is prone to subjectivity and is time-consuming. Surprisingly, despite the disadvantages, the integration of AI into the recruitment process is still slow. This chapter highlights the need to harness AI and the advantage technology could bring to the recruitment process. Some of the techniques that are garnering attention and widely used by organisations, such as chatbots, gamification, virtual employment interviews, and resume screening are described to enable the readers to understand with less effort. Chatbots and gamification techniques are described through process flow charts. We also describe the various types of interviews that could be conducted through virtual platforms and the modality by which the resume screening technique operates. Today, we are at a juncture wherein it is pertinent to acknowledge the superiority of technology-driven processes over traditional ones. This chapter will help the readers to understand the modus operandi to implement chatbots, gamification, virtual interviews and online resume screening techniques besides their advantages. Scope: Although chatbots, resume screening, virtual interviews, and gamification are used in other areas, too, such as training and development, marketing, etc., in this chapter, we restrict solely to employee recruitment processes. Methodology: Scoping review is used to examine the existing literature from various databases such as Google Scholar, IEEE, Proquest, Emerald, Elsevier, and JSTOR databases are used for extracting relevant articles. Findings: Automation and analytics in recruitment and selection remove bias which is otherwise increasingly found in manual hiring processes. Also, previous studies have observed that candidates engage in impression management tactics in traditional face-to-face interviews. However, through automated recruitment processes, the influence of these tactics can be eliminated. AI-based virtual interviews reduce human bias. It also helps recruiters to hire talents across the globe. Gamification improves the candidate\u2019s perception of the work and work environments. Through gamified techniques, the recruiters can understand whether a candidate possesses the required job skills. Chatbots are an interactive technique that can respond to interviewees\u2019 queries. Resume screening techniques can save the recruiter\u2019s time by screening and selecting the most appropriate candidates from a large pool. Hence, the chosen candidates alone can be referred to the next stage of the recruitment cycle. AI improves the efficiency of the recruitment process. It reduces mundane tasks. It saves time for the human resources (HR) team. \u00a9 2023 by V. R. Uma, Ilango Velchamy and Deepika Upadhyay.",

This capacity to scale discrimination in a way that may exclude certain groups from large segments of the labor market is a unique danger of AI vendors that warrants special scrutiny from Congress and regulators. Although underestimating the potential for harm, many scholars have also underestimated the effectiveness of current law in addressing these problems.

    "abstract": "Purpose: The primary objective of this study was to explore the various factors that impact the integration of artificial intelligence into HR processes, with a specific emphasis on boosting employee engagement. Given the increasing significance of technology adoption within organizations, we aimed to uncover ways in which artificial intelligence can be leveraged to provide enhanced services, ultimately leading to improved organizational success. Methodology: The study employed a hermeneutic phenomenological approach to investigate HR managers\u2019 adoption of technology, particularly AI, in HR management. In-depth interviews were conducted with 15 HR managers from 11 firms in Madhya Pradesh. The study explored how the personality differences of HR managers influenced their intention to adopt AI-based HR practices. The study sought to shed light on the hurdles HR managers face in accepting AI and the unique challenges encountered. Findings: From the study, we found that integrating AI into HR processes enhances efficiency, automates tasks, improves accuracy, and boosts employee engagement. However, drawbacks include employee resistance, privacy concerns, algorithm biases, and the need for human empathy in sensitive issues. HR managers must navigate these challenges while leveraging AI\u2019s benefits for a more efficient and successful organization. Practical Implications: This approach enabled a comprehensive understanding of HR managers\u2019 subjective experiences and perceptions regarding AI adoption while implementing measures to mitigate biases. Originality: In contrast to previous research on the incorporation of AI in HR practices, this case study specifically focused on investigating the challenges associated with integrating AI into HR practices. It aimed to identify these challenges and provide potential solutions to address them effectively. JEL Classification: L2, L8. \u00a9 2023, Associated Management Consultants Pvt. Ltd..

    "abstract": "This research paper presents an automated interview system that utilizes natural language processing and deep learning techniques to conduct job interviews. The system comprises 4 modules, the first one being resume classification system, which is built on state-of-the-art NLP architecture and transformer-based BERT model. The model uses Named Entity Recognition and Text Classification to extract relevant information from the resume. The resume classification algorithm is based on the principle of context relevance, and skill mentions in the resumes are validated through an analysis of the candidate's experience and completed projects before being classified. The subsequent module utilizes the output from the resume model to generate a set of relevant interview questions for the candidate through utilizing natural language processing techniques and semantic analysis. The difficulty of the following questions is adjusted owing to the interviewee's answer, very much like what human HRs do. Such questions are extracted with the help of web scraping by selenium driver. One of the most innovative parts of this system is its ability to reduce bias in the hiring process by using machine learning models to evaluate candidate responses. The following module assesses the candidate's personality during the interview using the CNN and LSTM models. In addition to generating relevant interview questions, the system also detects potential instances of misconduct or malpractice during the interview process using Open CV'S DNN module and a quantized model. Overall, this system has the potential to revolutionize the way companies conduct job interviews and improve the hiring process. \u00a9 2023 IEEE.",

The hiring process is a crucial aspect of any organization, as it determines the quality of the workforce and the success of the business. However, traditional hiring methods can be time-consuming and prone to bias. In this paper, we propose a better approach to hiring that leverages the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to automate and improve the efficiency of the process. Our proposed system allows managers to specify their requirements and receive a shortlist of candidates based on their skills, experience, and performance in a one-on-one interview with a photorealistic artificial intelligence bot. The bot also assesses candidates' confidence and body language to rank them accordingly. By using AI and machine learning in the hiring process, we can save time and reduce bias, leading to better-quality hires and a more productive workforce. \u00a9 2023 IEEE.",

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) as decision support for personnel preselection, e.g., in the form of a dashboard, promises a more effective and fairer selection process. However, AI-based decision support systems might prompt decision makers to thoughtlessly accept the system\u2019s recommendation. As this so-called automation bias contradicts ethical and legal requirements of human oversight for the use of AI-based recommendations in personnel preselection, the present study investigates strategies to reduce automation bias and increase decision quality. Based on the Elaboration Likelihood Model, we assume that instructing decision makers about the possibility of system errors and their responsibility for the decision, as well as providing an appropriate level of data aggregation should encourage decision makers to process information systematically instead of heuristically. We conducted a 3 (general information, information about system errors, information about responsibility) x 2 (low vs. high aggregated data) experiment to investigate which strategy can reduce automation bias and enhance decision quality. We found that less automation bias in terms of higher scores on verification intensity indicators correlated with higher objective decision quality, i.e., more suitable applicants selected. Decision makers who received information about system errors scored higher on verification intensity indicators and rated subjective decision quality higher, but decision makers who were informed about their responsibility, unexpectedly, did not. Regarding aggregation level of data, decision makers of the highly aggregated data group spent less time on the level of the dashboard where highly aggregated data were presented. Our results show that it is important to inform decision makers who interact with AI-based decision-support systems about potential system errors and provide them with less aggregated data to reduce automation bias and enhance decision quality. \u00a9 \u00a9 2023 Kupfer, Prassl, Flei\u00df, Malin, Thalmann and Kubicek.",

Indications for unrealistic optimism, i.e., assuming negative impacts are more likely for others than oneself, were identified. AI will play an increasingly important role, with cost reductions and efficiency gains serving as the highest motives and a lack of AI specialists representing the highest inhibitor. Participants assume that AI will reduce the number of employees in other companies, while it let the one in their own grow. They expect AI to take over more tasks in other companies and believe AI will more impact other companies\u2019 HRM, especially in administrative processing.

Discriminatory practices have been detected in many areas of private law where algorithms are used in the selection or decision-making process (e.g. in the context of loan financing, marketing, employment, and insurance). By looking into the EU legal framework, this chapter aims to analyse the selected instances of discriminatory practices caused by AI systems that occur in horizontal relationships (i.e. relationships between private individuals). More precisely, it focuses on two major fields of private law where the EU offers protection against discrimination, that is, employment matters and access to and the supply of goods and services. Although EU Member States may provide a higher level of protection in their national laws, this analysis takes a supranational approach and focuses exclusively on the protection guaranteed by EU law. \u00a9 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",

    "abstract": "This chapter looks at the normative and applied ethical standpoint and application of real-world technology challenges, with regard to Big Data (BD) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) domains and use-cases. In particular, how ethical technology design and utility can aid government policy makers, senior-management, software developers, and academic researchers in the quest for new knowledge and effective solutions. We discuss how biases are introduced by design in the workplace through technology and policy decision-making, how legal protections can become ambiguous through lack of definition, thus enhancing cyber-criminality, and demonstrate weakness in how the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) may adapt in light of new social phenomena and cultural change. We then propose legal applications with technical solutions that benefit societies in the addressing of core social operational/organisational themes and objectives, such as equality, diversity, gender pay-gap, racism, and the encouragement in the recruitment of women. This is undertaken from a combination of BD and AI ethical application perspectives, with a set of amalgamated criteria, the findings of which help identify factors for utilising in the design of a more ethically sound User Interface (UI). Three additional key socially controversial use-cases are presented (i.e., cyberstalking, sharenting, and, recruitment bias) and assessed alongside the set criteria to highlight current techno-social challenges, metrics, and applications that augment swift action in the mitigation of individual user risk. Thus, an ethically based UI Data Pipeline (VDaaS) is proposed in ensuring ethical, legal, technical objectives, and operations are met from a user perspective. \u00a9 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",

    "abstract": "Because artificial intelligence (AI) recruitment systems exhibited discriminatory decisions in recent applications, the adoption of such systems in industry has raised doubts. As equity has been emphasized in AI decision-making frameworks, the non-explainability issue regarding the high performance of AI methods has become prominent. Therefore, scholars have focused on human\u2013AI augmentation in which humans consider equity and AI supports the consideration. As a result, explainability is highlighted as a new capability of AI methods for an ideal decision. In this regard, this study proposes the so-called fairness, accountability, and transparency (FAT)-complexity, anxiety, and trust (CAT) model that describes the path from explainability to AI system adoption considering augmentation, assuming that the capability of the AI decision maker to explain the basis of its decision and interact with the human decision maker is crucial for AI recruitment system adoption. We found that explainability and augmentation are two key factors in AI recruitment system adoption and assessed that their importance will gradually increase as recruiters will be asked to use such AI systems more commonly. Moreover, this study conceptualized the role of an augmented relationship between humans and AI in decision-making, in which they complement each other's limitations. \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd",

    "abstract": "Whether we like it or not, algorithmic decision-making systems (ADMSs) are all around us. These systems assist both public institutions and private organizations in making decisions that exert a significant impact on our lives. The widespread use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) systems and the potential risks of using them are the subjects of intensive, ongoing research. It is imperative to ensure their fairness and transparency. The understanding that ADMSs should be subject to human supervision and examined for laypeople\u2019s perceived fairness is clear. Laypeople\u2019s perceptions regarding ADMSs\u2019 fairness, their understanding of the reasons underlying the systems\u2019 outcome (decision), and their comprehension of the linkage between the explanations and the results, influence their willingness to trust the systems, use them and accept their decisions. To determine and better understand which factors affect laypeople\u2019s perceptions of the fairness of algorithmic decisions, we conducted an online between-subject experiment, employing a case study of a simulated AI-based recruitment decision-support system. We focused on three aspects: system characteristics (SC), personality characteristics (PC), and demographic characteristics (DC). We conducted an in-depth analysis to determine which explanation increases the perceived fairness the most. Based on the results, we suggest a framework for predicting a layperson\u2019s perception of the fairness of the explanations. Our findings may help in understanding how to involve humans in the development and evaluation process of ADMSs, how to create personalized explanations based on the SC as well as on users\u2019 PC and DC, and, consequently, how to enhance laypeople\u2019s fairness perceptions regarding ADMSs. \u00a9 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

The purpose of this study is to systematize scholarly input on smart automation to date and to elucidate their primary contributions to the performance management difficulties. We found 45 publications on artificial intelligence, robotics as well as other technologically advanced within PM settings in the international business (IB) and general management (GM) and information management (IM) journals. The results demonstrate that smart automation technologies provide a new strategy to managing personnel and improving company performance, providing various performance management opportunities and also major technological and ethical problems. Its influence is based on performance management techniques such as job substitution, work collaboration between human robots and AI, policy-making and apprenticeship possibilities, and performance management activities, namely recruitment, education, and job performance.

    "abstract": "Employee turnover (ET) is a major issue faced by firms in all business sectors. Artificial intelligence (AI) machine learning (ML) prediction models can help to classify the likelihood of employees voluntarily departing from employment using historical employee datasets. However, output responses generated by these AI-based ML models lack transparency and interpretability, making it difficult for HR managers to understand the rationale behind the AI predictions. If managers do not understand how and why responses are generated by AI models based on the input datasets, it is unlikely to augment data-driven decision-making and bring value to the organisations. The main purpose of this article is to demonstrate the capability of Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) technique to intuitively explain the ET predictions generated by AI-based ML models for a given employee dataset to HR managers. From a theoretical perspective, we contribute to the International Human Resource Management literature by presenting a conceptual review of AI algorithmic transparency and then discussing its significance to sustain competitive advantage by using the principles of resource-based view theory. We also offer a transparent AI implementation framework using LIME which will provide a useful guide for HR managers to increase the explainability of the AI-based ML models, and therefore mitigate trust issues in data-driven decision-making. \u00a9 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

    "abstract": "Organisations increasingly rely on algorithms to exert automated managerial control over workers, referred to as algorithmic control (AC). The use of AC is already commonplace with platform-based work in the gig economy, where independent workers are paid for completing a given task (or \u201cgig\u201d). The combination of independent work alongside intensive managerial monitoring and guidance via AC raises questions about how gig workers perceive AC practices and judge their legitimacy, which could help explain critical worker behaviours such as turnover and non-compliance. Based on a three-dimensional conceptualisation of micro-level legitimacy tailored to the gig work context (autonomy, fairness, and privacy), we develop a research model that links workers\u2019 perceptions of two predominant forms of AC (gatekeeping and guiding) to their legitimacy judgements and behavioural reactions. Using survey data from 621 Uber drivers, we find empirical support for the central role of micro-level legitimacy judgements in mediating the relationships between gig workers\u2019 perceptions of different AC forms and their continuance intention and workaround use. Contrasting prior work, our study results show that workers do not perceive AC as a universally \u201cbad thing\u201d and that guiding AC is in fact positively related to micro-level legitimacy judgements.

    "abstract": "Assessing the psychological characteristics of job applicants\u2014including their vocational interests or personality traits\u2014has been a corner stone of hiring processes for decades. While traditional forms of such assessments require candidates to self-report their characteristics via questionnaire measures, recent research suggests that computers can predict people's psychological traits from the digital footprints they leave online (e.g., their Facebook profiles, Twitter posts or credit card spending). Although such models become increasingly available via third-party providers, the use of external data in the hiring process poses considerable ethical and legal challenges. In this paper, we examine the predictability of personality traits from models that are trained exclusively on data generated during the recruiting process. Specifically, we leverage information from CVs and free-text answers collected as part of a real-world, high-stakes recruiting process in combination with natural language processing to predict applicants' Big Five personality traits (N = 8,313 applicants). We show that the models provide consistent moderate predictive accuracy when comparing the machine learning-based predictions with the self-reported personality traits (average r = 0.25), outperforming recruiter judgments reported in prior literature. Although the models only capture a comparatively small part of the variance in self-reports, our findings suggest that they might still be relevant in practice by showing that automated predictions of personality are just as good (and sometimes better) at predicting key external criteria for job matching (i.e., vocational interests) as self-reported assessments. \u00a9 \u00a9 2024 Grunenberg, Peters, Francis, Back and Matz.",

Previous research has identified some of the challenges facing the application of Artificial Intelligence in Human Resources Management. Among these challenges is the varied nature of Human Resources functions. To address this, we adopt the Human Resource Life Cycle, which is composed of 6 dimensions that closely mirror the Human Resource functions that exist in many organizations: 1) Strategic Planning, 2) Recruitment and Deployment, 3) Training and Development, 4) Performance Management, 5) Compensation Management, and 6) Human Relations Management. Method: Through a scoping literature review, we have identified 85 articles on the topic and classified them based on the 6 dimensions of the Human Resource Life Cycle. Results: Our scoping review found that Artificial Intelligence has already been studied in relation to all 6 dimensions of the Human Resource Life Cycle. In addition, a seventh dimension was identified and integrated into the existing Human Resource Life Cycle framework: Legal and Ethical Issues. Based on the scoping review, a research agenda is presented to provide guidance for future research in the field of Artificial Intelligence in Human Resources Management. Conclusion: All 6 dimensions of the Human Resource Life Cycle, along with the seventh dimension \u2013 Legal and Ethical Issues \u2013 are already present in the literature. Future research could focus on the impact of AI on connections between dimensions, as well as the impact on HR-specific outcomes. Practitioners must recognize the limitations related to the application of AI in Human Resources Management, even though AI should still be viewed as a solution to many challenges facing Human Resources Management in organizations. \u00a9 Association for Information Systems.",

However, as the final hiring decision is likely to remain with humans, prevalent human biases could still cause discrimination. This work investigates the impact of an AI-based system\u2019s candidate recommendations on humans\u2019 hiring decisions and how this relation could be moderated by an Explainable AI (XAI) approach. We used a self-developed platform and conducted an online experiment with 194 participants. Our quantitative and qualitative findings suggest that the recommendations of an AI-based system can reduce discrimination against older and female candidates but appear to cause fewer selections of foreign-race candidates. Contrary to our expectations, the same XAI approach moderated these effects differently depending on the context. \u00a9 2022, The Author(s).",

    "abstract": "The use of algorithms systems that manage employees is now common in many industries. Trucking is no exception since freight companies need sophisticated systems to comply with legal obligations regarding driving time limitations. However, these systems often go far beyond simple GPS tracking, with other advanced surveillance devices being linked to performance management of truck drivers. Despite the growing literature emphasizing how the opacity of these systems may lead to perceived unjust automated decisions, no studies has empirically examined the relationships between algorithmic management transparency on truck driver attitudes. Hence, this study aims to quantitatively investigate the effect of the transparency of two algorithmic management functions (i.e., surveillance and performance management) on distributive and procedural justice. Moreover, considering that this industry faces an extraordinarily high turnover rate, the indirect relationship between algorithmic management transparency and driver's intention to quit through the mediating role of perceived justice will also be examined. Data were collected from 110 respondents via online communities of truck drivers. The results show that the transparency of algorithmic surveillance is positively related to procedural justice whereas the transparency of algorithmic performance management is positively related to distributive justice. Furthermore, our results show that procedural justice mediates the negative relationship between the transparency of algorithmic surveillance and intention to quit and that distributive justice mediates the negative relationship between the transparency of algorithmic performance management and intention to quit. Implications for theory and practice are discussed. \u00a9 2022 The Authors",

    "abstract": "Algorithmic control is expanding in various domains with the advances in programming algorithms, the continuous increase in hardware computing power, larger amounts of available fine-grained data, and an increasing number of organizations exercising remote work. Scholars and practitioners in human resource management posit that organizations\u2019 adoption of algorithms as a substitute for or supplement to traditional rational control mechanisms to direct, discipline, and evaluate workers might increase the objectivity and transparency of worker-related decision-making processes and, therefore, reduce the power asymmetry and inequality within organizations. This discussion commentary argues that the underlying assumptions of the higher objectivity and transparency of algorithms in organizational control are very strong, and current evidence does not support them. There is also evidence of large variation in organizations\u2019 adoption of algorithmic control due to their current technical, structural, and human capital resources, which further blurs the predicted outcomes. Evidence also exists for an over-reliance on algorithmic suggestions by managers to circumvent accountability. Adopting algorithmic control must therefore be conducted with serious precautions. This article proposes that overestimation of objectivity and transparency, and large variation in organizations\u2019 adoption of AC (including the lack of technical and managerial knowledge of the underlying mechanisms of learning algorithms in some organizations, and the complete abandonment of human intuitive judgment and reasoning in others) could worsen the power asymmetry and inequality within organizations by increasing the opacity of decisions, systematic biases, discriminatory classification, and violation of worker privacy. \u00a9 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",

    "abstract": "The increasing prevalence of large-scale labor aggregation platforms, worker analytics, and algorithmic decision-making by management raises the question of whether workers can use similar technologies to advocate for their own goals. Yet, there are inherent challenges in building worker-centric tools that collect, aggregate, and share data in responsible and ethical ways. In this paper, we present the design and deployment of the Shipt Calculator, a tool developed in collaboration with non-profit worker groups that allows app-based delivery workers to track and share aggregate data about their pay, increasing wage transparency. We first discuss the design challenges inherent to building worker-centric technologies, particularly for informally organized workers, and ground our discussion in the history of worker inquiry and co-research. We then describe some principles from this history and our own lessons in designing the Calculator that can be applied by future researchers and advocates seeking to build technical tools for organizing campaigns. Finally, we share the results of using the Calculator to audit an app's shift to a black-box pay model using data contributed by 140 workers in the Summer of 2020, finding that although the average pay per-order increased under the new payment model, almost half of workers experienced an unannounced pay cut during the shift, and many workers worked shifts that paid under their state's minimum wage. Finally, we discuss how tools like the Calculator demonstrate the important role that aggregate worker data, and a new Digital Workerism, can serve in creating and maintaining a more balanced platform economy. \u00a9 2022 Owner/Author.",

Digital technologies are devices that rely on rapidly accelerating digital sensing, storage, and transmission capabilities to intervene in human processes. While the ethics of technology is analyzed across disciplines from science and technology studies (STS), engineering, computer science, critical management studies, and law, less attention is paid to the role that firms and managers play in the design, development, and dissemination of technology across communities and within their firm. This book covers the topic from three angles. First, it illuminates diverse facets of the intersection of technology and business ethics. Second, it uses themes to explore what business ethics offers to the study of technology and, third, what technology studies offers to the field of business ethics. Each field brings expertise that, together, improves our understanding of the ethical implications of technology.

This trend is reinforced by the technology industry claiming that its decision-making tools are efficient and objective, downplaying their potential biases. In our manuscript, we identify an important challenge arising from the efficiency-driven logic of algorithm-based HR decision-making, namely that it may shift the delicate balance between employees' personal integrity and compliance more in the direction of compliance. We suggest that critical data literacy, ethical awareness, the use of participatory design methods, and private regulatory regimes within civil society can help overcome these challenges.

While the impact of AI on human resource (HR) and people management is difficult to predict, the article considers potential scenarios for how AI will affect our field. We argue that although popular accounts of AI stress the risks of bias and unfairness, these problems are eminently solvable. However, the way that the AI industry is currently constituted and wider trends in the use of technology for organising work mean that there is a significant risk that AI use will degrade the quality of work. Viewing different scenarios through a paradox lens, we argue that both positive and negative visions of the future are likely to coexist. The HR profession has a degree of agency to shape the future if it chooses to use it; HR professionals need to develop the skills to ensure that ethics and fairness are at the centre of AI development for HR and people management. \u00a9 2022 The Authors.

    "abstract": "Orientation: The Fourth Industrial Revolution has transformed modern society by ushering in the fusion of advances in robotics, the Internet of Things (IoT), genetic engineering, quantum computing, and artificial intelligence (AI) among others. AI brings a range of different technologies and applications to interact with environments that comprise both the relevant objects and the interaction rules and have the capacity to process information in a way that resembles intelligent behaviour. Similarly, artificial intelligence is also being used in the human resources management (HRM) processes and functions in the public sector to map sequences to actions. Research purpose: The study explores the opportunities, challenges, and future prospects of integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Public Sector Human Resource Management (HRM) in South Africa\u2019s public sector. Motivation for the study: The study was motivated by the need to examine the dynamics surrounding the adoption, implementation and operationalisation of the 4IR in the management of human resources in the SA public sector in this unfolding dispensation. Research Approach: Data was collected using the extensive review of written records such as books, journal articles, book chapters among others which were purposively selected for use in this study. Data was analysed using content and thematic analysis techniques. Research Findings: The study established that Artificial Intelligence is beneficial in the sense that it can improve public service delivery in South Africa as the HRM personnel is enabled to focus more on the strategic areas of management by taking over routine tasks, and that it helps minimize bias in public service recruitment and selection. In contrast, research on potential challenges has revealed that combining Artificial Intelligence and Public Sector Human Resource Management may pose a threat to white-collar jobs. Practical/ Managerial Implications: This study may lead to practical applications of AI to support the HR functions of public sector entities in SA. The public managers are better informed about the impediments, gaps and opportunities that may arise from using AI in managing human resources in SA\u2019s public sector. Contributions: This study contributes to the body of knowledge as it unpacks and informs the dynamics associated with the implementation of AI in managing human resources in public sector entities. \u00a9 2022.

    "abstract": "Purpose: The number of candidates applying to public contests (PC) is increasing compared to the number of human resources employees required for selecting them for the Police Force (PF). This work intends to perceive how those public institutions can evaluate and select their candidates efficiently during the different phases of the recruitment process. To achieve this purpose, artificial intelligence (AI) was studied. This paper aims to focus on analysing the AI technologies most used and appropriate to the PF as a complementary recruitment strategy of the National Criminal Investigation police agency of Portugal \u2013 Pol\u00edcia Judici\u00e1ria. Design/methodology/approach: Using design science research as a methodological approach, the authors suggest a theoretical framework in pair with the segmentation of the candidates and comprehend the most important facts facing public institutions regarding the usage of AI technologies to make decisions about evaluating and selecting candidates. Following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses methodology guidelines, a systematic literature review and meta-analyses method was adopted to identify how the usage and exploitation of transparent AI positively impact the recruitment process of a public institution, resulting in an analysis of 34 papers between 2017 and 2021. Findings: Results suggest that the conceptual pairing of evaluation and selection problems of candidates who apply to PC with applicable AI technology such as K-means, hierarchical clustering, artificial neural network and convolutional neural network algorithms can support the recruitment process and could help reduce the workload in the entire process while maintaining the standard of responsibility. The combination of AI and human decision-making is a fair, objective and unbiased process emphasising a decision-making process free of nepotism and favouritism when carefully developed. Innovative and modern as a category, group the statements that emphasise the innovative and contemporary nature of the process. Research limitations/implications: There are two main limitations in this study that should be considered. Firstly, the difficulty regarding the timetable, privacy and legal issues associated with public institutions. Secondly, a small group of experts served as the validation group for the new framework. Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted to alleviate this constraint. They provide additional insights into an interviewee\u2019s opinions and beliefs. Social implications: Ensure that the system is fair, transparent and facilitates their application process. Originality/value: The main contribution is the AI-based theoretical framework, applicable within the analysis of literature papers, focusing on the problem of how the institutions can gain insights about their candidates while profiling them, how to obtain more accurate information from the interview phase and how to reach a more rigorous assessment of their emotional intelligence providing a better alignment of moral values. This work aims to improve the decision-making process of a PF institution recruiter by turning it into a more automated and evidence-based decision when recruiting an adequate candidate for the job vacancy. \u00a9 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.",

    "abstract": "Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) enable new ways of exercising and experiencing power by automating interpersonal tasks such as interviewing and hiring workers, managing and evaluating work, setting compensation, and negotiating deals. As these techniques become more sophisticated, they increasingly support personalization where users can \u201ctell\u201d their AI assistants not only what to do, but how to do it: in effect, dictating the ethical values that govern the assistant's behavior. Importantly, these new forms of power could bypass existing social and regulatory checks on unethical behavior by introducing a new agent into the equation. Organization research suggests that acting through human agents (i.e., the problem of indirect agency) can undermine ethical forecasting such that actors believe they are acting ethically, yet a) show less benevolence for the recipients of their power, b) receive less blame for ethical lapses, and c) anticipate less retribution for unethical behavior. We review a series of studies illustrating how, across a wide range of social tasks, people may behave less ethically and be more willing to deceive when acting through AI agents. We conclude by examining boundary conditions and discussing potential directions for future research. \u00a9 2022",

    "abstract": "Professional and lifelong learning are a necessity for workers. This is true both for re-skilling from disappearing jobs, as well as for staying current within a professional domain. AI-enabled scaffolding and just-in-time and situated learning in the workplace offer a new frontier for future impact of AIED. The hallmark of this community\u2019s work has been i) data-driven design of learning technology and ii) machine-learning enabled personalized interventions. In both cases, data are the foundation of AIED research and data-related ethics are thus central to AIED research. In this paper we formulate a vision how AIED research could address data-related ethics issues in informal and situated professional learning. The foundation of our vision is a secondary analysis of five research cases that offer insights related to data-driven adaptive technologies for informal professional learning. We describe the encountered data-related ethics issues. In our interpretation, we have developed three themes: Firstly, in informal and situated professional learning, relevant data about professional learning \u2013 to be used as a basis for learning analytics and reflection or as a basis for adaptive systems - is not only about learners. Instead, due to the situatedness of learning, relevant data is also about others (colleagues, customers, clients) and other objects from the learner\u2019s context. Such data may be private, proprietary, or both. Secondly, manual tracking comes with high learner control over data. Thirdly, learning is not necessarily a shared goal in informal professional learning settings. From an ethics perspective, this is particularly problematic as much data that would be relevant for use within learning technologies hasn\u2019t been collected for the purposes of learning. These three themes translate into challenges for AIED research that need to be addressed in order to successfully investigate and develop AIED technology for informal and situated professional learning. As an outlook of this paper, we connect these challenges to ongoing research directions within AIED \u2013 natural language processing, socio-technical design, and scenario-based data collection - that might be leveraged and aimed towards addressing data-related ethics challenges. \u00a9 2021, The Author(s).",

First, we identify six management functions that algorithms are currently able to perform: monitoring, goal setting, performance management, scheduling, compensation, and job termination. Second, we show how each AM function affects key job resources (e.g., job autonomy, job complexity) and key job demands (e.g., workload, physical demands); with each of these resources and demands being important drivers of worker motivation and their well-being. Third, rejecting a deterministic perspective and drawing on sociotechnical systems theory, we outline key categories of variables that moderate the link between AM on work design, namely transparency, fairness and human influence (e.g., whether workers can control the system). We summarize our review in the form of a model to help guide research on AM, and to support practitioners and designers in the creation and maintenance of meaningful jobs in the era of algorithms. \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Inc.",

    "abstract": "With AI-based decisions playing an increasingly consequential role in our society, for example, in our financial and criminal justice systems, there is a great deal of interest in designing algorithms conforming to application-specific notions of fairness. In this work, we ask a complementary question: can AI-based decisions be designed to dynamically influence the evolution of fairness in our society over the long term? To explore this question, we propose a framework for sequential decision-making aimed at dynamically influencing long-Term societal fairness, illustrated via the problem of selecting applicants from a pool consisting of two groups, one of which is under-represented. We consider a dynamic model for the composition of the applicant pool, in which admission of more applicants from a group in a given selection round positively reinforces more candidates from the group to participate in future selection rounds. Under such a model, we show the efficacy of the proposed Fair-Greedy selection policy which systematically trades the sum of the scores of the selected applicants (\"greedy'') against the deviation of the proportion of selected applicants belonging to a given group from a target proportion (\"fair''). In addition to experimenting on synthetic data, we adapt static real-world datasets on law school candidates and credit lending to simulate the dynamics of the composition of the applicant pool. We prove that the applicant pool composition converges to a target proportion set by the decision-maker when score distributions across the groups are identical. \u00a9 2022 Owner/Author.",

    "abstract": "Subset selection is an integral component of AI systems that is increasingly affecting people's livelihoods in applications ranging from hiring, healthcare, education, to financial decisions. Subset selections powered by AI-based methods include top-k analytics, data summarization, clustering, and multi-winner voting. While group fairness auditing tools have been proposed for classification systems, these state-of-The-Art tools are not directly applicable to measuring and conceptualizing fairness in selected subsets. In this work, we introduce the first comprehensive auditing framework, FINS, to support stakeholders in interpretably quantifying group fairness across a diverse range of subset-specific fairness concerns. FINS offers a family of novel measures that provide a flexible means to audit group fairness for fairness goals ranging from item-based, score-based, and a combination thereof. FINS provides one unified easy-To-understand interpretation across these different fairness problems. Further, we develop guidelines through the FINS Fair Subset Chart, that supports auditors in determining which measures are relevant to their problem context and fairness objectives. We provide a comprehensive mapping between each fairness measure and the belief system (i.e., worldview) that is encoded within its measurement of fairness. Lastly, we demonstrate the interpretability and efficacy of FINS in supporting the identification of real bias with case studies using AirBnB listings and voter records. \u00a9 2022 ACM.",

    "abstract": "Recent years have seen rapid advancements in selection assessments, shifting away from human and toward algorithmic judgments of candidates. Indeed, algorithmic recruitment tools have been created to screen candidates\u2019 resumes, assess psychometric characteristics through game-based assessments, and judge asynchronous video interviews, among other applications. While research into candidate reactions to these technologies is still in its infancy, early research in this regard has explored user experiences and fairness perceptions. In this article, we review applicants\u2019 perceptions of the procedural fairness of algorithmic recruitment tools based on key findings from seven key studies, sampling over 1,300 participants between them. We focus on the sub-facets of behavioral control, the extent to which individuals feel their behavior can influence an outcome, and social presence, whether there is the perceived opportunity for a social connection and empathy. While perceptions of overall procedural fairness are mixed, we find that fairness perceptions concerning behavioral control and social presence are mostly negative. Participants feel less confident that they are able to influence the outcome of algorithmic assessments compared to human assessments because they are more objective and less susceptible to manipulation. Participants also feel that the human element is lost when these tools are used since there is a lack of perceived empathy and interpersonal warmth. Since this field of research is relatively under-explored, we end by proposing a research agenda, recommending that future studies could examine the role of individual differences, demographics, and neurodiversity in influencing fairness perceptions of algorithmic recruitment. \u00a9 \u00a9 2022 Hilliard, Guenole and Leutner.",

    "abstract": "Resume screening assisted by decision support systems that incorporate artificial intelligence is currently undergoing a strong development in many organizations, raising technical, managerial, legal, and ethical issues. The purpose of the present paper is to better understand the reactions of recruiters when they are offered algorithm-based recommendations during resume screening. Two polarized attitudes have been identified in the literature on users\u2019 reactions to algorithm-based recommendations: algorithm aversion, which reflects a general distrust and preference for human recommendations; and automation bias, which corresponds to an overconfidence in the decisions or recommendations made by algorithmic decision support systems (ADSS). Drawing on results obtained in the field of automated decision support areas, we make the general hypothesis that recruiters trust human experts more than ADSS, because they distrust algorithms for subjective decisions such as recruitment. An experiment on resume screening was conducted on a sample of professionals (N = 694) involved in the screening of job applications. They were asked to study a job offer, then evaluate two fictitious resumes in a 2 \u00d7 2 factorial design with manipulation of the type of recommendation (no recommendation/algorithmic recommendation/human expert recommendation) and of the consistency of the recommendations (consistent vs. inconsistent recommendation). Our results support the general hypothesis of preference for human recommendations: recruiters exhibit a higher level of trust toward human expert recommendations compared with algorithmic recommendations. However, we also found that recommendation\u2019s consistence has a differential and unexpected impact on decisions: in the presence of an inconsistent algorithmic recommendation, recruiters favored the unsuitable over the suitable resume. Our results also show that specific personality traits (extraversion, neuroticism, and self-confidence) are associated with a differential use of algorithmic recommendations. Implications for research and HR policies are finally discussed. \u00a9 \u00a9 2022 Lacroux and Martin-Lacroux.",

But individuals can be legitimately grouped in many different ways. Using a framework and fairness constraints explored in research on algorithmic fairness, I show that eliminating certain forms of bias across groups for one way of classifying individuals can make it impossible to eliminate such bias across groups for another way of dividing people up. And this point generalizes if we require merely that assessments be approximately bias-free. Moreover, even if the fairness constraints are satisfied for some given partitions of the population, the constraints can fail for the coarsest common refinement, that is, the partition generated by taking intersections of the elements of these coarser partitions. This shows that these prominent fairness constraints admit the possibility of forms of intersectional bias. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2022.",

AI applications can be found in various stages of recruiting, such as writing job ads, screening of applicant resumes, and analyzing video interviews via face recognition software. As these new technologies significantly impact people\u2019s lives and careers but often trigger ethical concerns, the ethicality of these AI applications needs to be comprehensively understood. However, given the novelty of AI applications in recruiting practice, the subject is still an emerging topic in academic literature. To inform and strengthen the foundation for future research, this paper systematically reviews the extant literature on the ethicality of AI-enabled recruiting to date. We identify 51 articles dealing with the topic, which we synthesize by mapping the ethical opportunities, risks, and ambiguities, as well as the proposed ways to mitigate ethical risks in practice. Based on this review, we identify gaps in the extant literature and point out moral questions that call for deeper exploration in future research. \u00a9 2022, The Author(s).",

The use of algorithms holds promise for overcoming human biases in decision-making, but they frequently make decisions that discriminate. Media coverage suggests that people are morally outraged by algorithmic discrimination, but here we examine whether people are less outraged by algorithmic discrimination than by human discrimination. Eight studies test this algorithmic outrage deficit hypothesis in the context of gender discrimination in hiring practices across diverse participant groups (online samples, a quasi-representative sample, and a sample of tech workers). We find that people are less morally outraged by algorithmic (vs. human) discrimination and are less likely to hold the organization responsible. The algorithmic outrage deficit is driven by the reduced attribution of prejudicial motivation to algorithms. Just as algorithms dampen outrage, they also dampen praise\u2014companies enjoy less of a reputational boost when their algorithms (vs. employees) reduce gender inequality. Our studies also reveal a downstream consequence of algorithmic outrage deficit\u2014people are less likely to find the company legally liable when the discrimination was caused by an algorithm (vs. a human). We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these results, including the potential weakening of collective action to address systemic discrimination. \u00a9 2022 American Psychological Association",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence is a tool used by human intelligence and technology to improve various fields' performance. In the simplest sense, AI is a branch of intelligence involved in constructing intelligent machines that can be used for work that usually requires human understanding. Human resources management plays a vital role in the company's management and generally encompasses people and their behaviour. HR policies are a set of guidelines for the organisation's management of its staff. Today, HR managers must examine the skills and talents required by employee artificial intelligence in different departments. The problem identified here is that human limitations, such as biases, preconceptions, and time restrictions, can prevent an HRM process's effectiveness. This is a problem because it can lead an organisation to lose its job and monetary value candidates. The chapter discusses artificial intelligence's influence on job/work and HRM where we are focusing mostly on small manufacturing units. \u00a9 2022 World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte. Ltd.",

    "abstract": "While rapid advances in artificial intelligence (AI) hiring tools promise to transform the workplace, these algorithms risk exacerbating existing biases against marginalized groups. In light of these ethical issues, AI vendors have sought to translate normative concepts such as fairness into measurable, mathematical criteria that can be optimized for. However, questions of disability and access often are omitted from these ongoing discussions about algorithmic bias. In this paper, I argue that the multiplicity of different kinds and intensities of people\u2019s disabilities and the fluid, contextual ways in which they manifest point to the limits of algorithmic fairness initiatives. In particular, existing de-biasing measures tend to flatten variance within and among disabled people and abstract away information in ways that reinforce pathologization. While fair machine learning methods can help mitigate certain disparities, I argue that fairness alone is insufficient to secure accessible, inclusive AI. I then outline a disability justice approach, which provides a framework for centering disabled people\u2019s experiences and attending to the structures and norms that underpin algorithmic bias. \u00a9 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",

    "abstract": "Algorithms have become increasingly relevant in supporting human resource (HR) management, but their application may entail psychological biases and unintended side effects on employee behavior. This study examines the effect of the type of HR decision (i.e., promoting or dismissing staff) on the likelihood of delegating these HR decisions to an algorithm-based decision support system. Based on prior research on algorithm aversion and blame avoidance, we conducted a quantitative online experiment using a 2\u00d72 randomly controlled design with a sample of N = 288 highly educated young professionals and graduate students in Germany. This study partly replicates and substantially extends the methods and theoretical insights from a 2015 study by Dietvorst and colleagues. While we find that respondents exhibit a tendency of delegating presumably unpleasant HR tasks (i.e., dismissals) to the algorithm\u2014rather than delegating promotions\u2014this effect is highly conditional upon the opportunity to pretest the algorithm, as well as individuals\u2019 level of trust in machine-based and human forecast. Respondents\u2019 aversion to algorithms dominates blame avoidance by delegation. This study is the first to provide empirical evidence that the type of HR decision affects algorithm aversion only to a limited extent. Instead, it reveals the counterintuitive effect of algorithm pretesting and the relevance of confidence in forecast models in the context of algorithm-aided HRM, providing theoretical and practical insights. \u00a9 \u00a9 2022 Maasland and Wei\u00dfm\u00fcller.",

It unravels the human resource development-related challenges with the onset of Industry 4.0. Design/methodology/approach: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 32 professionals with average work experience of 7.6 years and working across nine industries, and the transcripts were analyzed using NVivo. Findings: The findings establish prominent adverse impacts of the adoption of AI, namely, information security, data privacy, drastic changes resulting from digital transformations and job risk and insecurity brewing in the employee psyche. This is followed by a hierarchy of factors comprising the positive impacts, namely, work-related flexibility and autonomy, creativity and innovation and overall enhancement in job performance. Further factors contributing to technostress (among employees): work overload, job insecurity and complexity were identified. Practical implications: The emerging knowledge economy and technological interventions are changing the existing job profiles, hence the need for different skillsets and technological competencies. The organizations thus need to deploy strategic manpower development measures involving up-gradation of skills and knowledge management. Inculcating requisite skills requires well-designed training programs using specialized tools and virtual reality (VR). In addition, employees need to be supported in their evolving socio-technical relationships, for managing both positive and negative outcomes. Originality/value: This research makes the unique contribution of establishing a qualitative hierarchy of prominent factors constituting unintended consequences, positive impacts and technostress creators (among employees) of AI deployment in organizational processes. \u00a9 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: This paper aims to specifically focus on the challenges that human resource management (HRM) leaders and departments in contemporary organisations face due to close interaction between artificial intelligence (AI) (primarily robots) and human workers especially at the team level. It further discusses important potential strategies, which can be useful to overcome these challenges based on a conceptual review of extant research. Design/methodology/approach: The current paper undertakes a conceptual work where multiple streams of literature are integrated to present a rather holistic yet critical overview of the relationship between AI (particularly robots) and HRM in contemporary organisations. Findings: We highlight that interaction and collaboration between human workers and robots is visible in a range of industries and organisational functions, where both are working as team members. This gives rise to unique challenges for HRM function in contemporary organisations where they need to address workers' fear of working with AI, especially in relation to future job loss and difficult dynamics associated with building trust between human workers and AI-enabled robots as team members. Along with these, human workers' task fulfilment expectations with their AI-enabled robot colleagues need to be carefully communicated and managed by HRM staff to maintain the collaborative spirit, as well as future performance evaluations of employees. The authors found that organisational support mechanisms such as facilitating environment, training opportunities and ensuring a viable technological competence level before organising human workers in teams with robots are important. Finally, we found that one of the toughest challenges for HRM relates to performance evaluation in teams where both humans and AI (including robots) work side by side. We referred to the lack of existing frameworks to guide HRM managers in this concern and stressed the possibility of taking insights from the computer gaming literature, where performance evaluation models have been developed to analyse humans and AI interactions while keeping the context and limitations of both in view. Originality/value: Our paper is one of the few studies that go beyond a rather general or functional analysis of AI in the HRM context. It specifically focusses on the teamwork dimension, where human workers and AI-powered machines (robots) work together and offer insights and suggestions for such teams' smooth functioning. \u00a9 2021, Ahmad Arslan, Cary Cooper, Zaheer Khan, Ismail Golgeci and Imran Ali.",

Design/methodology/approach: An iterative \u201cscoping review\u201d method was used to capture and synthesize relevant academic and grey literature. This is suited to emerging areas of innovation where formal research lags behind evidence from professional or technical sources. Findings: Although the grey literature contains a growing stream of publications aimed at helping PA practitioners to \u201cbe ethical,\u201d overall, research on ethical issues in PA is still at an early stage. Optimistic and technocentric perspectives dominate the PA discourse, although key themes seen in the wider literature on digital/data ethics are also evident. Risks and recommendations for PA projects concerned transparency and diverse stakeholder inclusion, respecting privacy rights, fair and proportionate use of data, fostering a systemic culture of ethical practice, delivering benefits for employees, including ethical outcomes in business models, ensuring legal compliance and using ethical charters. Research limitations/implications: This research adds to current debates over the future of work and employment in a digitized, algorithm-driven society. Practical implications: The research provides an accessible summary of the risks, opportunities, trade-offs and regulatory issues for PA, as well as a framework for integrating ethical strategies and practices. Originality/value: By using a scoping methodology to surface and analyze diverse literatures, this study fills a gap in existing knowledge on ethical aspects of PA. The findings can inform future academic research, organizations using or considering PA products, professional associations developing relevant guidelines and policymakers adapting regulations.

    "abstract": "Purpose: In 2018, an artificial intelligence (AI) interview platform was introduced and adopted by companies in Korea. This study aims to explore the perspectives of applicants who have experienced an AI-based interview through this platform and examines the opinions of companies, a platform developer and academia. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a phenomenological approach. The participants, who had recent experience of AI video interviews, were recruited offline and online. Eighteen job applicants in their 20s, two companies that have adopted this interview platform, a software developer who created the platform and three professors participated in the study. To collect data, focus group interviews and in-depth interviews were conducted. Findings: As a result, all of them believed that an AI-based interview was more efficient than a traditional one in terms of cost and time savings and is likely to be adopted by more companies in the future. They pointed to the possibility of data bias requiring an improvement in AI accountability. Applicants perceived an AI-based interview to be better than traditional evaluation procedures in procedural fairness, objectivity and consistency of algorithms. However, some applicants were dissatisfied about being assessed by AI. Digital divide and automated inequality were recurring themes in this study. Originality/value: The study is important, as it addresses the real application of AI in detail, and a case study of smart hiring tools would be valuable in finding the practical and theoretical implications of such hiring in the fields of employment and AI. \u00a9 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",

    "abstract": "This cutting-edge Handbook offers a comprehensive introduction to the emerging research field of artificial intelligence (AI) in human resource management (HRM). Broadly mapping AI fields relevant for HR, it not only considers the more well-known areas of machine learning and natural language processing, but also lesser-known fields such as affective computing and robotic process automation. Expert contributors analyze the applications of machine learning in human resources, including machine learning on text data, audio and video data, social media data, and in recruiting and staffing. They also explore a range of innovative topics such as knowledge representation and reasoning, and evolutionary computing. Discussing the explainability, fairness, accountability, and legitimacy of AI in HR, chapters bring normative issues to the fore. Approaches to researching AI in HR and to employing AI in HR research are also tackled. Offering an insight into existing research on artificial intelligence in human resources, the Handbook introduces core issues and considers implications for future research. This Handbook will be critical reading for scholars and students of human resource management, knowledge management, organizational innovation, computer science, and information systems. It will also be beneficial for practitioners in these fields. \u00a9 Stefan Strohmeier 2022. All rights reserved.",

    "abstract": "This article uses computational text analysis to study the form and content of more than 3000 recommendation letters submitted on behalf of applicants to a major U.S. anesthesiology residency program. The article finds small differences in form and larger differences in content. Women applicants' letters were more likely to contain references to acts of service, for example, whereas men were more likely to be described in terms of their professionalism and technical skills. Some differences persisted when controlling for standardized aptitude test scores, on which women and men scored equally on average, and other applicant and letter-writer characteristics. Even when all explicit gender-identifying language was stripped from the letters, a machine learning algorithm was able to predict applicant gender at a rate better than chance. Gender stereotyped language in recommendation letters may infect the entirety of an employer's hiring or selection process, implicating Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Not all gendered language differences were large, however, suggesting that small changes may remedy the problem. The article closes by proposing a computationally driven system that may help employers identify and eradicate bias, while also prompting a rethinking of our gendered, racialized, ableist, ageist, and otherwise stereotyped occupational archetypes. \u00a9 2022 The Author.

    "abstract": "Text-based artificial intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly integrated into a host of interpersonal domains. Although decision-making and person perception in hiring and employment opportunities have been an area of psychological interest for many years, only recently have scholars begun to investigate the role that AI plays in this context. To better understand the impact of AI in employment-related contexts, we conducted two experiments investigating how the use of AI by applicants influences their job opportunities. In our preregistered Study 1, we examined how a prospective job applicants' use of AI, as well as their language status (native English speaker or non-native English speaker), influenced participants' impressions of their warmth, competence, social attractiveness, and hiring desirability. In Study 2, we examined how receiving assistance impacted interpersonal perceptions, and how perceptions might change whether the help was provided by AI or by another human. The results from both experiments suggest that the use of AI technologies can negatively influence perceptions of jobseekers. This negative impact may be grounded in the perception of receiving any type of help, whether it be from a machine or a person. These studies provide additional evidence for the Computers as Social Actors framework and advance our understanding of AI-Mediated Communication. The results also raise questions about transparency and deception related to AI use in interpersonal contexts. \u00a9 \u00a9 2022 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",

    "abstract": "This article analyzes emerging artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced lie detection systems from ethical and human resource (HR) management perspectives. I show how these AI enhancements transform lie detection, followed with analyses as to how the changes can lead to moral problems. Specifically, I examine how these applications of AI introduce human rights issues of fairness, mental privacy, and bias and outline the implications of these changes for HR management. The changes that AI is making to lie detection are altering the roles of human test administrators and human subjects, adding machine learning-based AI agents to the situation and establishing invasive data collection processes as well as introducing certain biases in results. I project that the potentials for pervasive and continuous lie detection initiatives (\u201ctruth machines\u201d) are substantial, displacing human-centered efforts to establish trust and foster integrity in organizations. I argue that if it is possible for HR managers to do so, they should cease using technologically-based lie detection systems entirely and work to foster trust and accountability on a human scale. However, if these AI-enhanced technologies are put into place by organizations by law, agency mandate, or other compulsory measures, care should be taken that the impacts of the technologies on human rights and wellbeing are considered. The article explores how AI can displace the human agent in some aspects of lie detection and credibility assessment scenarios, expanding the prospects for inscrutable, \u201cblack box\u201d processes and novel physiological constructs (such as \u201cbiomarkers of deceit\u201d) that may increase the potential for such human rights concerns as fairness, mental privacy, and bias. Employee interactions with autonomous lie detection systems rather with than human beings who administer specific tests can reframe organizational processes and rules concerning the assessment of personal honesty and integrity. The dystopian projection of organizational life in which analyses and judgments of the honesty of one\u2019s utterances are made automatically and in conjunction with one\u2019s personal profile provides unsettling prospects for the autonomy of self-representation. \u00a9 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",

In particular, we test how information on workers\u2019 performance affects their recruiter choice and whether the algorithmic recruiter is perceived as more or less gender-biased than the human one. We find that workers do perceive human and algorithmic evaluation differently, even though both recruiters are given the same inputs in our controlled setting. Specifically, human recruiters are perceived to be more error-prone evaluators and place more weight on personal characteristics, whereas algorithmic recruiters are seen as placing more weight on task performance. Consistent with these perceptions, workers with good task performance relative to others prefer algorithmic evaluation, whereas those with lower task performance prefer human evaluation. We also find suggestive evidence that perceived differences in gender bias drive preferences for human versus algorithmic recruitment. \u00a9 2021",

In this paper we discuss some of the legal and ethical concerns in the HR context that accompany machine learning. Legal concerns include possible violations of both US employment discrimination laws and the provisions of the European General Data Protection Regulation, while ethical concerns for HR revolve around employee desires for privacy and justice. We assess that some data analysis activities that are legal nonetheless might not be appropriate in some cases and might be demotivating to employees, resulting in lowered performance or even counterproductive behaviors if HR mishandles the context. We conclude by offering guidelines for HR managers to assess the appropriateness of machine learning projects. \u00a9 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",

The tool is a socio-technical assessment of hiring ADSs that is aimed at surfacing the underlying assumptions that justify the use of an algorithmic tool and the forms of knowledge or insight they purport to produce. These underlying assumptions, it is argued, are crucial for assessing not only whether an ADS works \u201cas intended,\u201d but also whether the intentions with which the tool was designed are well founded. Throughout, we contextualize the use of the matrix within current and proposed regulatory regimes and within emerging hiring practices that incorporate algorithmic technologies. We suggest using the matrix to expose underlying assumptions rooted in pseudo-scientific essentialized understandings of human nature and capability and to critically investigate emerging auditing standards and practices that fail to address these assumptions. \u00a9 2021 The Author(s)",

This study explores the public perceptions of algorithms used in resume and video interview screening. In addition, the effects of individual characteristics on these perceptions are examined. Using a nationally representative sample, we find that the public generally has a negative attitude towards the use of algorithms in hiring, and the majority do not consider them fair and effective. We also find clear individual differences regarding the perceptions towards algorithms. Specifically, males, people with higher education level and people with higher income have more positive perceptions towards hiring algorithms than their counterparts. The findings contribute to the emerging body of research on hiring algorithms and suggest strategies to increase public acceptance of hiring algorithms. \u00a9 2022",

Using a matched sample set of resumes (348k resumes), we train a deep learning model to inductively learn differences between male and female resumes with similar job-relevant characteristics. We use this model to develop a measure of gender-incongruence - i.e., measure of how much the self-presented gender characteristics in the resume deviate from the self-reported gender of the candidate. We then test whether applicants whose resume gender characteristics deviate from their self-reported gender are less likely to receive a callback. \u00a9 2022 82nd Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management 2022: A Hybrid Experience, AOM 2022.All rights reserved.",

However, AI-enabled recruiting and talent management tools have also introduced risks of unfair bias that may compromise workforce diversity. This conceptual paper frames an ethical discussion regarding gender equity in AI-enabled workforce decision applications. The authors examined several real-world cases in which AI was used in talent acquisition. The ensuing question is whether the use of AI in the hiring process can be turned into an advantage to improve gender equity. To address the question, a multi-faceted trustworthy AI framework was reviewed and applied to the workforce decision context. A list of implementation guidelines is proposed to mitigate bias and increase diversity in the IT workforce. The authors aim to stimulate further discussions and investigation on this complex topic and to call for action to develop educational programs or awareness campaigns on trustworthy AI, so improving gender equity in technology hiring. \u00a9 2022 IEEE.",

We found age bias, or ageism, in hiring decisions is implicit and more prevalent than other well-reported forms of bias, such as race or gender biases, yet ageism is also far more difficult for job candidate search algorithms to ignore.

The purpose of this paper is to explore key elements in transferring knowledge of the AI implementation process in human resource management (HRM) from the perspective of AI consultants. This study utilizes qualitative data analysis techniques. We first review the literature and then conduct in-depth semistructured interviews with eight AI consultants. We analyze transcripts using the ATLAS.ti software. First, this research reveals that AI implementation is affected by a shortage of employee data, no clear vision, a limited understanding of the AI decisions framework and managers\u2019 desire to bypass AI decisions. Second, the combination of an intensive training program and assigning AI specialists is the best way to transfer the knowledge of AI implementation processes to HR managers. Third, HR managers should create communication channels and enhance employees\u2019 awareness of the positive impact that AI solutions have on smooth collaboration with AI-employees. The paper also reveals that accelerating the process of implementing AI applications has no negative impact in COVID-19 times. However, an AI bias may be considered a potential threat for AI implementation. This paper attempts to provide a practical understanding of the elements that facilitate AI implementation in the HRM process. It provides vital insights for HR managers and AI developers to benchmark their activities when designing and adopting AI solutions. It also contributes to the literature by responding to the question of how AI implementation should be provided to HR managers and employees. \u00a9 2022, International Journal of Business Science and Applied Management.

The results underline the need for hybrid adaptation, where accountants learn to adopt AI as a group rather than individually. In the second study, the analysis explores the use of AI in the recruitment and selection of personnel in the Cypriot banking sector. The research draws on findings collected through online interviews with Human Resource managers, where none of the five banks participating in the study use AI in their recruitment process. Respondents attributed this lacuna to the traditional and casual approaches to downsizing, restructuring, technical challenges, and ethical considerations. Evidence emerging from these studies enables us to compare and contrast the narrative around AI (accounting) with its actual impact (banking). \u00a9 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",

We use an interdisciplinary methodology to test our hypotheses: observing a human-led recruitment panel and building an explainable algorithmic prototype from the ground up, to quantify gender bias. The key findings of this study are threefold: identifying potential sources of human bias from a recruitment panel's ranking of CVs; identifying sources of bias from a potential algorithmic pipeline which simulates human decision making; and recommending ways to mitigate bias from both aspects. Our research has provided an innovative research design that combines social science and data science to theorise how automation may introduce bias in hiring practices, and also pinpoint where it is introduced. It also furthers the current scholarship on gender bias in hiring practices by providing key empirical inferences on the factors contributing to bias. \u00a9 2022 IEEE.",

To discuss concerns about potential bias in such systems, this chapter focuses on AI to support human resource decisions (e.g., selecting among job applicants). As AI systems do not inherently harbor prejudices, they could increase fairness and reduce bias. We discuss, however, that bias can be introduced via: (i) human influence in the system design, (ii) the training data supplied to the system, and (iii) human involvement in processing system recommendations. For each of the above factors we review and suggest possible solutions to reduce/remove bias. Notably, developing AI systems for screening decisions increased scrutiny for bias and raised awareness about pre-existing bias in human decision patterns which AI systems were trained to emulate. \u00a9 2022 selection and editorial matter, Andrew J.

    "abstract": "People analytics depicts the algorithmization of human resources management characterized by the data-driven automation and support of people-related processes or tasks. On the one hand, people analytics promises productivity increases through optimizing workforce planning, hiring, or talent development. On the other hand, the extensive data collection and analysis of employees\u2019 behaviors can be perceived as invasive, raising privacy concerns. This debate cannot only be explained by diverging norms and values, for example, practitioners realizing commercial opportunities while being criticized by academic commentaries. Instead, an alternative explanation suggests that the opposing views can be reconciled by diving into the conceptual differences regarding what analytical methods and data sources people analytics entails. Hence, this paper proposes the conceptions of operational and strategic people analytics based on a literature review of academics\u2019 and practitioners\u2019 literature. Four propositions about these conceptions\u2019 privacy and performance implications are derived. Future research should empirically validate these propositions. \u00a9 BLED 2022.

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology (BCT) are considered two of the most trending and disruptive technologies. BCT, although commonly associated with cryptocurrencies, has shown a tremendous impact among many other distributed applications domains. BCT characteristics, such as the distribution of data storage among independent nodes and the use of consensus algorithms offer immutability and transparency and remove the need for a central authority making BCT trustworthy. However, decision-makers and stakeholders currently lack the confidence to overcome uncertainty related to AI technology, which affects the acceptance of AI technology in wider application domains, such as the recruitment process. Furthermore, current research literature does not adequately investigate the role of trust as an integral part of an AI-based recruitment application. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate how emerging BCT and AI technologies can improve decision making and stakeholder trust in a job recruitment system that is traditionally focused on just human expert decision-making. In this paper we propose the design of a new solution for trusting AI in recruitment applications through the use of Blockchain Smart Contracts (TAIRA-BSC). TAIRA-BSC integrates Blockchain Smart Contracts (BSC) with the Data Lake (DL), Machine Learning (ML) and AI technologies in our AI Recruitment Model (AIRM) architecture. TAIRA-BSC improves transparency and interoperability in the recruitment process while protecting sensitive job candidate data and ensures data integrity delivery and traceability in the recruiting process through a verifiable decentralized ledger, i.e., the blockchain and associated smart contracts. The paper presents a discussion on the state-of-the-art of integrating AI with BCT focusing on how BCT can be used to bridge trust concerns with AI systems. We also present a conceptual architecture TAIRA-BSC proof of concept that is developed to serve as a foundation for future studies focused on enhancing trust in AI applications through the integration of BCT. \u00a9 2022 IEEE.",

The AI vendors and employers have mainly been left to self-regulate except for the recent enactment of Illinois's Artificial Intelligence Video Interview Act.

While AI can expedite the recruitment process, evidence from the industry, however, shows that AI-recruitment systems (AIRS) may fail to achieve unbiased decisions about applicants. There are risks of encoding biases in the datasets and algorithms of AI which lead AIRS to replicate and amplify human biases. To develop less biased AIRS, collaboration between HR managers and AI developers for training algorithms and exploring algorithmic biases is vital. Using an exploratory research design, 35 HR managers and AI developers globally were interviewed to understand the role of knowledge sharing during their collaboration in mitigating biases in AIRS. The findings show that knowledge sharing can help to mitigate biases in AIRS by informing data labeling, understanding job functions, and improving the machine learning model.

Numerous organizations use ML-based procedures for screening large candidate pools, while some companies try to automate the hiring process as far as possible. Since ML models can handle large sets of predictor variables and are therefore able to incorporate many different data sources (often more than common procedures can consider), they promise a higher predictive accuracy and objectivity in selecting the best candidate than traditional personal selection processes. However, there are some pitfalls and challenges that have to be taken into account when using ML for a sensitive issue as personnel selection. In this paper, we address these major challenges-namely the definition of a valid criterion, transparency regarding collected data and decision mechanisms, algorithmic fairness, changing data conditions, and adequate performance evaluation-and discuss some recommendations for implementing fair, transparent, and accurate ML-based selection algorithms. \u00a9 2022 Hogrefe Publishing GmbH.

Organisations increasingly rely on people analytics to optimise human resource management practices in areas such as recruitment, performance evaluation, personnel development, health and retention management. Recent progress in the field of AI and ever-increasing volumes of digital data have raised expectations and contributed to a very positive image of people analytics. However, transferring and applying the efficiency-driven logic of analytics to manage humans carries numerous risks, challenges, and ethical implications. Based on a theorising review our paper analyses perils that can emerge from the use of people analytics. By disclosing the underlying assumptions of people analytics and offering a perspective on current and future technological advancements, we identify six perils and discuss their implications for organisations and employees. Then, we illustrate how these perils may aggravate with increasing analytical power of people analytics, and we suggest directions for future research.

This study therefore aims to systematize the academic inputs on intelligent automation so far and to clarify what are its main contributions to and challenges for HRM. In a systematic search of 13,136 potentially relevant studies published in the top HRM, international business (IB), general management (GM) and information management (IM) journals, we found 45 articles studying artificial intelligence, robotics and other advanced technologies within HRM settings. Results show that intelligent automation technologies constitute a new approach to managing employees and enhancing firm performance, thus offering several opportunities for HRM but also considerable challenges at a technological and ethical level. The impact of these technologies has been identified to concentrate on HRM strategies, namely, job replacement, human-robot/AI collaboration, decision-making and learning opportunities, and HRM activities, namely, recruiting, training and job performance.

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence has evolved as an alternative to human intelligence. It affects the lives of billions of people. It mimics humans by solving problems and understanding the task. These Artificial Intelligence technologies must have some moral values and ethics incorporated within itself. The usage of AI is growing worldwide, posing more ethical issues to consider. In recent years, many companies have used various Artificial Intelligence tools such as chatbots and face recognition software for fulfilling their hiring needs. This research work will focus on such devices that help manage one of the important functions of human resources: recruitment. It will identify various challenges and ethical issues that a firm faces while assimilating Artificial Intelligence tools in the process of Recruitment. The hiring companies need to make the job seekers realize that AI-powered tools would be free from discrimination and safeguard privacy. The purpose of the study is to identify the ethical issues while incorporating Artificial Intelligence into hiring needs. The study will be based on reviews and features of applications. The study mentions various applications whose features might be unethical for job seekers. Findings reveal that the significant unethical issues faced by the hiring companies are Data privacy and unconscious biasness. The biasness is due to the algorithm that works according to the inputs fed to build it, and the programmer might have subconscious biasness in his mind. AI has restored concerns regarding privacy and data protection. According to a report by UNESCO, Women make up only 22% of all AI professionals. Gender prejudices and stereotyping are perpetuated in AI technologies due to their underrepresentation in the sector. Virtual personal assistants like Siri, Alexa, and Cortana are \u201cfemale\u201d by default, which is no accident. The submissiveness they display is an illustration of how Artificial Intelligence (AI) might continue to support and extend gender bias in our society. \u00a9 2022 by the author.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly inputting into various human resource management (HRM) functions, such as sourcing job applicants and selecting staff, allocating work, and offering personalized career coaching. While the use of AI for such tasks can offer many\u00a0benefits, evidence suggests that without careful and deliberate implementation its use also has the potential to generate significant harms. This raises several ethical concerns regarding the appropriateness of AI deployment to domains such as HRM, which directly deal with managing sometimes sensitive aspects of individuals\u2019 employment lifecycles. However, research at the intersection of HRM and technology continues to largely\u00a0center on examining what AI can be used for, rather than focusing on the salient factors relevant to its ethical use and examining how to effectively engage human workers in its use. Conversely, the ethical AI literature offers excellent guiding principles for AI implementation broadly, but there remains much scope to explore how these principles can be enacted in specific contexts-of-use. By drawing on ethical AI and\u00a0task-technology fit literature, this paper constructs a decision-making framework to support the ethical deployment of AI for HRM and guide determinations of the optimal mix of human and machine involvement for different HRM tasks. Doing so supports the deployment of AI for the betterment of work and workers and generates both scholarly and practical outcomes. \u00a9 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",

    "abstract": "According to a recent survey by the HR Research Institute, as the presence of artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly common in the workplace, HR professionals are worried that the use of recruitment algorithms will lead to a \u201cdehumanization\u201d of the hiring process. Our main goals in this paper are threefold: (i) to bring attention to this neglected issue, (ii) to clarify what exactly this concern about dehumanization might amount to, and (iii) to sketch an argument for why dehumanizing the hiring process is ethically suspect. After distinguishing the use of the term \u201cdehumanization\u201d in this context (i.e. removing the human presence) from its more common meaning in the interdisciplinary field of dehumanization studies (i.e. conceiving of other humans as subhuman), we argue that the use of hiring algorithms may negatively impact the employee-employer relationship. We argue that there are good independent reasons to accept a substantive employee-employer relationship, as well as an applicant-employer relationship, both of which are consistent with a stakeholder theory of corporate obligations. We further argue that dehumanizing the hiring process may negatively impact these relationships because of the difference between the values of human recruiters and the values embedded in recruitment algorithms. Drawing on Nguyen\u2019s (in: Lackey, Applied Epistemology, Oxford University Press, 2021) critique of how Twitter \u201cgamifies communication\u201d, we argue that replacing human recruiters with algorithms imports artificial values into the hiring process. We close by briefly considering some ways to potentially mitigate the problems posed by recruitment algorithms, along with the possibility that some difficult trade-offs will need to be made. \u00a9 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",

However, AI is also posing challenges to organisations and key assumptions about digital innovation processes and outcomes, making it unclear how to combine AI affordances with actors, goals, and tasks. We conducted a qualitative multiple-case study in Scandinavian organisations offering HR services. Grounded theory guided our data collection and analysis. Input-Process-Output framework and affordance theory supported the analysis of specific information processing constraints and enablers. We developed a framework to explain how AI affordances enable digital innovation and address the calls about definitional boundaries between innovation processes and outcomes. We showed how AI affordances are actualised and how this leads to reontologising decision-making and providing data driven legitimisation. Our study contributes to digital innovation research by elucidating AI affordances and their actualisation in organisations. We conclude with the implications to theory and practice, limitations, and suggestions for future research. \u00a9 2021",

    "abstract": "Over the years, companies have adopted hiring algorithms because they promise wider job candidate pools, lower recruitment costs and less human bias. Despite these promises, they also bring perils. Using them can inflict unintentional harms on individual human rights. These include the five human rights to work, equality and nondiscrimination, privacy, free expression and free association. Despite the human rights harms of hiring algorithms, the AI ethics literature has predominantly focused on abstract ethical principles. This is problematic for two reasons. First, AI principles have been criticized for being vague and not actionable. Second, the use of vague ethical principles to discuss algorithmic risks does not provide any accountability. This lack of accountability creates an algorithmic accountability gap. Closing this gap is crucial because, without accountability, the use of hiring algorithms can lead to discrimination and unequal access to employment opportunities. This paper makes two contributions to the AI ethics literature. First, it frames the ethical risks of hiring algorithms using international human rights law as a universal standard for determining algorithmic accountability. Second, it evaluates four types of algorithmic impact assessments in terms of how effectively they address the five human rights of job applicants implicated in hiring algorithms. It determines which of the assessments can help companies audit their hiring algorithms and close the algorithmic accountability gap. \u00a9 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",

    "abstract": "Purpose Residency programs face overwhelming numbers of residency applications, limiting holistic review. Artificial intelligence techniques have been proposed to address this challenge but have not been created. Here, a multidisciplinary team sought to develop and validate a machine learning (ML)-based decision support tool (DST) for residency applicant screening and review. Method Categorical applicant data from the 2018, 2019, and 2020 residency application cycles (n = 8,243 applicants) at one large internal medicine residency program were downloaded from the Electronic Residency Application Service and linked to the outcome measure: interview invitation by human reviewers (n = 1,235 invites). An ML model using gradient boosting was designed using training data (80% of applicants) with over 60 applicant features (e.g., demographics, experiences, academic metrics). Model performance was validated on held-out data (20% of applicants). Sensitivity analysis was conducted without United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) scores. An interactive DST incorporating the ML model was designed and deployed that provided applicant- and cohort-level visualizations. Results The ML model areas under the receiver operating characteristic and precision recall curves were 0.95 and 0.76, respectively; these changed to 0.94 and 0.72, respectively, with removal of USMLE scores. Applicants' medical school information was an important driver of predictions - which had face validity based on the local selection process - but numerous predictors contributed. Program directors used the DST in the 2021 application cycle to select 20 applicants for interview that had been initially screened out during human review. Conclusions The authors developed and validated an ML algorithm for predicting residency interview offers from numerous application elements with high performance - even when USMLE scores were removed. Model deployment in a DST highlighted its potential for screening candidates and helped quantify and mitigate biases existing in the selection process. Further work will incorporate unstructured textual data through natural language processing methods. \u00a9 2021 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins. All rights reserved.",

This paper builds on the algorithm aversion literature and the third-party reactions to mistreatment model to investigate a wider array of reactions to erring algorithms. Using an experimental design deployed with a vignette-based online study, we investigate gut reactions, justice cognitions, and behavioral intentions toward erring algorithms (compared to erring humans). Our results show that when the error was committed by an algorithm (vs. a human), gut reactions were harsher (i.e., less acceptance and more negative feelings), justice cognitions weaker (i.e., less blame, less forgiveness, and less accountability), and behavioral intentions stronger. These results remain independent of factors such as the maturity of the algorithms (better than or same as human performance), the severity of the error (high or low), and the domain of use (recruitment or finance). We discuss how these results complement the current literature thanks to a robust and more nuanced pattern of reactions to erring algorithms. \u00a9 2021 The Authors",

    "abstract": "Technology is changing the way in which workers are controlled. From video cameras to GPS, these technologies allow for constant monitoring of workers' activities; however, recently two new forms of control have emerged. One consisting in giving customers a controlling role over workers' performance and another, the \"big data\" (algorithms and artificial intelligence) which allow employers to process information about their employees in a far more efficient manner and at a much lower cost than has been the case until now. This makes it possible to profile workers automatically and even allows technology itself to replace human resources supervisors and managers and to make decisions that have legal effects on the employees (recruitment, promotion, dismissals, etc.). This entails great risks of discrimination by the technology in command, as well as the defenselessness of the worker, who is unaware of the reasons underlying such a decision and specific health and occupational risks for workers. This study analyzes the risks that these new technologies are posing to workers and what challenges labor law is facing. \u00a9 The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.

However, the literature indicates that candidate reactions to a selection process need to be considered by organizations that compete for employees. In this study, we investigate reactions to AI-based selection procedures in a three-dimensional vignette study among young adults in Germany. By investigating the effects of the dimensions of AI complexity, intangibility, and reliability on the perceived quality of assessment of potential candidates, we found that AI complexity and intangibility impact the perceived quality of assessment negatively when the candidates\u2019 knowledge, strengths, and weaknesses should be assessed. We also found interactive relationships of all three dimensions for the assessment of motivation. In sum, results indicate that candidates are skeptical toward the assessment quality of AI-intense selection processes, especially if these assess complex assessment criteria such as personality or a job performance forecast. Hence, organizations need to be careful when implementing AI-based selection procedures. HR implications are made on the basis of these results to cope with negative candidate perceptions. \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2021 Schick and Fischer.",

Historically, women of color, particularly those with marginalized religious identities, have more challenges in securing employment. We conducted 20 semi-structured interviews with Muslim-American women of color who had used online job platforms in the past two years to understand how they perceive digital hiring tools to be used in practice, how they navigate the US job market, and how hiring discrimination as a phenomenon is thought to relate to their intersecting social identities. Our findings allowed us to identify three major categories of asymmetries (i.e., the relationship between the computing algorithms' structures and their users' experiences): (1) process asymmetries, which is the lack of transparency in data collection processes of job applications; (2) information asymmetries, which refers to the asymmetry in data availability during online job-seeking; and (3) legacy asymmetries, which explains the cultural and historical factors impacting marginalized job applicants. We discuss design implications to support job seekers in identifying and securing positive employment outcomes. \u00a9 2021 ACM.",

    "abstract": "With the growing use of machine learning algorithms in highly consequential domains, the quantification and removal of disparity in decision making with respect to protected attributes, such as gender, race, etc., is becoming increasingly important. While quantifying disparity is essential, sometimes the needs of a business (e.g., hiring) may require the use of certain features that are critical in a way that any disparity that can be explained by them might need to be exempted. For instance, in hiring a software engineer for a safety-critical application, a coding-test score may be a critical feature that is weighed strongly in the decision even if it introduces disparity, whereas other features, such as name, zip code, or reference letters may be used to improve decision-making, but only to the extent that they do not add disparity. In this work, we propose a novel information-theoretic decomposition of the total disparity (a quantification inspired from counterfactual fairness) into two components: a non-exempt component which quantifies the part of the disparity that cannot be accounted for by the critical features, and an exempt component which quantifies the remaining disparity. This decomposition is important: it allows one to check if the disparity arose purely due to the critical features (inspired from the business necessity defense of disparate impact law) and also enables selective removal of the non-exempt component of disparity if desired. We arrive at this decomposition through canonical examples that lead to a set of desirable properties (axioms) that any measure of non-exempt disparity should satisfy. We then demonstrate that our proposed counterfactual measure of non-exempt disparity satisfies all of them. Our quantification bridges ideas of causality, Simpson's paradox, and a body of work from information theory called Partial Information Decomposition (PID). We also obtain an impossibility result showing that no observational measure of non-exempt disparity can satisfy all of the desired properties, which leads us to relax our goals and examine alternative observational measures that satisfy only some of these properties. We perform case studies to show how one can audit existing models as well as train new models while reducing non-exempt disparity. \u00a9 1963-2012 IEEE.",

    "abstract": "Business psychologists study and assess relevant individual differences, such as intelligence and personality, in the context of work. Such studies have informed the development of artificial intelligence systems (AI) designed to measure individual differences. This has been capitalized on by companies who have developed AI-driven recruitment solutions that include aggregation of appropriate candidates (Hiretual), interviewing through a chatbot (Paradox), video interview assessment (MyInterview), and CV-analysis (Textio), as well as estimation of psychometric characteristics through image-(Traitify) and game-based assessments (HireVue) and video interviews (Cammio). However, driven by concern that such high-impact technology must be used responsibly due to the potential for unfair hiring to result from the algorithms used by these tools, there is an active effort towards proving mechanisms of governance for such automation. In this article, we apply a systematic algorithm audit framework in the context of the ethically critical industry of algorithmic recruitment systems, exploring how audit assessments on AI-driven systems can be used to assure that such systems are being responsibly deployed in a fair and well-governed manner. We outline sources of risk for the use of algorithmic hiring tools, suggest the most appropriate opportunities for audits to take place, recommend ways to measure bias in algorithms, and discuss the transparency of algorithms. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

There are some promising approaches, but many of them are based on a \u201dfair\u201d ground truth, others are based on a subjective goal to be reached, which leads to the usual problem of how to define and compute \u201dfairness\u201d. The different functioning of algorithmic decision making in contrast to human decision making leads to a shift from a process-oriented to a result-oriented discrimination assessment. We argue that with such a shift society needs to determine which kind of fairness is the right one to choose for which certain scenario. To understand the implications of such a determination we explain the different kinds of fairness concepts that might be applicable for the specific application of hiring decisions, analyze their pros and cons with regard to the respective fairness interpretation and evaluate them from a legal perspective (based on EU law). \u00a9 2021 Marc P.

    "abstract": "Companies are increasingly using artificial intelligence (AI) to provide performance feedback to employees, by tracking employee behavior at work, automating performance evaluations, and recommending job improvements. However, this application of AI has provoked much debate. On the one hand, powerful AI data analytics increase the quality of feedback, which may enhance employee productivity (\u201cdeployment effect\u201d). On the other hand, employees may develop a negative perception of AI feedback once it is disclosed to them, thus harming their productivity (\u201cdisclosure effect\u201d). We examine these two effects theoretically and test them empirically using data from a field experiment. We find strong evidence that both effects coexist, and that the adverse disclosure effect is mitigated by employees' tenure in the firm. These findings offer pivotal implications for management theory, practice, and public policies. Managerial abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are bound to transform how companies manage employees. We examine the use of AI to generate performance feedback for employees. We demonstrate that AI significantly increases the accuracy and consistency of the analyses of information collected, and the relevance of feedback to each employee. These advantages of AI help employees achieve greater job performance at scale, and thus create value for companies. However, our study also alerts companies to the negative effect of disclosing using AI to employee that results from employees' negative perceptions about the deployment of AI, which offsets the business value created by AI. To alleviate value-destroying disclosure effect, we suggest that companies be more proactive in communicating with their employees about the objectives, benefits, and scope of AI applications in order to assuage their concerns. Moreover, the result of the allayed negative AI disclosure effect among employees with a longer tenure in the company suggests that companies may consider deploying AI in a tiered instead of a uniform fashion, that is, using AI to provide performance feedback to veteran employees but using human managers to provide performance feedback to novices. \u00a9 2021 The Authors.

The development of chatbots evolved rapidly to efficiently collect information in numerous fields, including customer service, health care, and etc. However, there was limited discussion of how chatbots are used to conduct an interview process autonomously. A human-driven interview also has some major limitations, e.g., it may only be conducted on a small-scale and is susceptible to bias. Hence, this study provides the design of a chatbot to conduct an interview, as well as processing the interview result by using Artificial Intelligence (AI) or machine learning. We have identified the difference between the typical chatbot communication method and the interview bot. This finding can be an opportunity to make a new interview bot or improve the implementation of a chatbot. In the end, we also discuss the challenges and benefits of the development of an interview bot. \u00a9 2021 IEEE.",

    "abstract": "Fairness is a key issue that requires the attention of human resource management practitioners. Having a robust methodical procedure for identifying the value of job positions in an enterprise is essential. Consequently, there is a need for a job evaluation system that ensures fair compensation for each position. A poorly defined job evaluation system creates the dilemma of mismatches between employees and their competencies for their responsibilities and, accordingly, their wages. This results in employee dissatisfaction, which ultimately exacerbates attrition, which is costly because of the loss of talented employees. This paper proposes a VIKOR algorithm as an innovative approach to job evaluations. Engineering-related positions in an international aviation company were analyzed to illustrate the appropriateness of the proposed approach for managing the job evaluation dilemma. The results indicate that 29 job grades would be appropriate for this firm. In addition, the proposed algorithm was found to be superior to other multiple-criteria decision-making techniques at managing the job evaluation dilemma. \u00a9 2021 by the author.",

Massive and diverse information is obtained through log files, web crawlers and other means.

Privacy authorization is becoming more and more formal, and the risk of privacy leakage caused by technical vulnerabilities is also increasing. The current dilemmas faced by employees' right to privacy include: unclear definitions of employees' right to privacy, lack of labor legislation, and high costs of information protection.

College admissions decisions have traditionally relied heavily on academic characteristics like GPA and standardized testing.

Machine Learning (ML) could assist in admitting a more diverse student body, but algorithmic bias could be introduced. Our goal is to develop software tools to minimize human bias in admissions while actively eliminating algorithmic bias. We will examine past admissions data and identify risks of use of possible privileged values, which have historically put certain groups at a disadvantage.

    "abstract": "Subset selection algorithms are ubiquitous in AI-driven applications, including, online recruiting portals and image search engines, so it is imperative that these tools are not discriminatory on the basis of protected attributes such as gender or race. Currently, fair subset selection algorithms assume that the protected attributes are known as part of the dataset. However, protected attributes may be noisy due to errors during data collection or if they are imputed (as is often the case in real-world settings). While a wide body of work addresses the effect of noise on the performance of machine learning algorithms, its effect on fairness remains largely unexamined. We find that in the presence of noisy protected attributes, in attempting to increase fairness without considering noise, one can, in fact, decrease the fairness of the result! Towards addressing this, we consider an existing noise model in which there is probabilistic information about the protected attributes (e.g., [19, 32, 44, 56]), and ask is fair selection possible under noisy conditions? We formulate a \"denoised\"selection problem which functions for a large class of fairness metrics; given the desired fairness goal, the solution to the denoised problem violates the goal by at most a small multiplicative amount with high probability. Although this denoised problem turns out to be NP-hard, we give a linear-programming based approximation algorithm for it. We evaluate this approach on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Our empirical results show that this approach can produce subsets which significantly improve the fairness metrics despite the presence of noisy protected attributes, and, compared to prior noise-oblivious approaches, has better Pareto-tradeoffs between utility and fairness. \u00a9 2021 ACM.",

However, bias prevalent in an organization\u2019s model could create meaningful issues, ranging from incorrect hiring decisions to a negative impact on an organization\u2019s image. Organizations often lack the knowledge or time to create a model in line with society\u2019s standards, leading to the utilization of faulty systems. Here, we present a framework to help combat this issue, allowing organizations to prevent bias in their models. Our framework starts with a general guidebook to clarify relevant terminology and provide best practices for developers to measure and mitigate bias. We then incorporate an automated algorithm based on statistical parity and disparate impact to de-bias raw data. We apply SMOTE-Tomek to resample imbalanced datasets and a Reject Option Classification algorithm to reduce biased predictions. We infer adding more data related to minority and unprivileged classes to datasets will help create more equitable and representative datasets leading to fair AI systems for all. We propose a novel decentralized database using web-scraping and homomorphic encryption as a reliable source of real-world data. Our assumed hypotheses were confirmed by data derived from extensive testing. \u00a9 IEOM Society International.",

This study investigates the challenges AI faces in the hiring process and the outcomes/ results of using AI in the hiring process. The benefits of using AI in the hiring process include identifying AI vendors and firms that have adopted AI in the hiring process, analyzing the present state of AI to facilitate the hiring process, and the impact of adopting AI in the hiring process. Through this study, different perceptions, theories, ideas, and opinions are presented to modulate the use of AI in human resource management utilizing papers from 1988 to 2020. The findings indicate that AI is adopted mainly in high-tech or large companies. The reports presented by these companies on the use of AI thus do not provide an actual picture of the usage and step by step evaluation as interviews are still a part of the recruitment process providing space for human bias. Future research may include aligning the AI with the mission and vision of the company and the rules and regulations of the country that they have been adopted. The aspect of AI to support human resources in decision making, not a threat as AI is considered to take over the human roles in human resource management, should also be studied in detail. \u00a9 2021 IEEE.",

    "abstract": "Our voices can reveal intimate details about our lives. Yet, many privacy discussions have focused on the threats from speakerrecognition and speech recognition. This Note argues that this focusoverlooks another privacy risk: voice-inferred information. This termdescribes non-obvious information drawn from voice data through acombination of machine learning, artificial intelligence, data mining,and natural language processing. Companies have latched onto voiceinferredinformation. Early adopters have applied the technology insituations as varied as lending risk analysis and hiring. Consumers maybalk at such strategies, but the current United States privacy regimeleaves voice insights unprotected. By applying a notice and consentprivacy model via sector-specific statutes, the hodgepodge of U.S.federal privacy laws allows voice-inferred information to slip throughthe regulatory cracks. This Note reviews the current legal landscape andidentifies existing gaps. It then suggests two solutions that balance voiceprivacy with technological innovation: purpose-based consent andindependent data review boards. The first bolsters voice protectionwithin the traditional notice and consent framework, while the secondimagines a new protective scheme. Together, these solutionscomplement each other to afford the human voice the protection itdeserves \u00a9 2021 Emma Ritter",

In this regard, we aim to understand the relationship between induced algorithmic fairness and its perception in humans. In particular, we are interested in whether these two are positively correlated and reflect substantive fairness. Furthermore, we also study how does induced algorithmic fairness affects user trust in algorithmic decision making. To understand this, we perform a user study to simulate candidate shortlisting by introduced (manipulating mathematical) fairness in a human resource recruitment setting. Our experimental results demonstrate that different levels of introduced fairness are positively related to human perception of fairness, and simultaneously it is also positively related to user trust in algorithmic decision making. Interestingly, we also found that users are more sensitive to the higher levels of introduced fairness than the lower levels of introduced fairness. Besides, we summarize the theoretical and practical implications of this research with a discussion on perception of fairness. \u00a9 2021 IEEE",

    "abstract": "The compensation management of high-Tech enterprises in the information age needs strategic thinking. It obeys and serves the enterprise strategy. Its significance is to help enterprises control risks, strive for profits and maximize enterprise benefits in the future development competition. With the wide application of artificial intelligence, big data and other technologies in enterprise human resource management, with the advantages of big data and the use of cloud computing and other processing technologies, we can record and analyze the daily work content, work objectives and task completion of employees, realize the comprehensive evaluation of different employees, and quickly generate the compensation results corresponding to employee performance, it greatly improves the timeliness and accuracy of compensation management. Artificial intelligence uses these data to analyze the correlation between compensation and position grade by establishing mathematical model, so as to set up enterprise compensation grade and compensation standard more reasonably; At the same time, through more scientific data comparison and calculation, we can truly realize the fairness of compensation, turn compensation and reward into data support, and improve the fairness and transparency of enterprise management. This paper analyzes the influence of the factors related to the enterprise strategy in the information age on the compensation management of high-Tech enterprises, probes into the main problems existing in the compensation management of high-Tech enterprises at the present stage, and puts forward some countermeasures for constructing the compensation management corresponding to the strategy of high-Tech enterprises. \u00a9 2021 IEEE.",

    "abstract": "Algorithmic assessments of personal characteristics gleaned from social networks are regularly used to rate people in fields ranging from insurance premiums, to hiring decisions and employment chances, to social security benefits. These algorithms comb through huge datasets (such as information uploaded by users on social networks) to \u201clearn\u201d correlations and trends between certain characteristics and to generate \u201cpeople-rankings\u201d, which systematically rate individuals based on social, reputational, physical, mental and even behavioural features. Because such algorithms equally apply to people with, and without, disabilities, they are particularly pernicious for people with disabilities. In other words, the algorithms rank persons with disabilities lower (or as less desirable) than able-bodied individuals, resulting in discrimination against those with disabilities by the public and private sector organisations that rely on such algorithms. Legislative action is needed to provide people with disabilities with legal protection from such algorithmic discrimination, regardless of whether such discrimination is purposeful or inadvertent. Because such algorithms are used across a wide variety of industries, legislation requiring that similarly situated disabled and able-bodied persons receive the same algorithmic ranking can dramatically help to improve the life quality and opportunities available for people with disabilities. \u00a9 2021, Sweet and Maxwell-Thomson Reuters.

    "abstract": "Algorithms have found their way into courtrooms, college admission committees, and human resource departments. While defendants and other disappointed parties have challenged the use of algorithms on the basis of due process or similar objections, it should be expected that they will also challenge their accuracy and attempt to present algorithms of their own in order to contest the decisions of judges and other authorities. The problem with this approach is that people who can transparently see why they have been algorithmically denied rights or resources can manipulate an algorithm by retrofitting data. Demands for full algorithmic transparency by policy makers and legal scholars are therefore misguided. To overcome algorithmic manipulation, we present the novel solution of algorithmic competition. This approach, versions of which have been deployed in finance, would work well in law. We show how the state, a university, or an employer should set aside untested data in a lockbox. Parties to a decision then develop their respective algorithms and compete. The algorithm that performs best with the lockbox data wins. While this approach presents several complications that this Article discusses in detail, it is superior to full disclosure of data and algorithmic transparency. \u00a9 2021 University of Chicago Law School.

This process has accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic and on a global scale, as more services, resources and information move online. An important, if under-studied example of this trend is e-recruitment. Job seekers increasingly rely upon automated platforms to find and apply for jobs, and their fate in these selection processes are often automated. Drawing on data from the German LEO study and ethnographic interviews with job seekers in community-based digital literacy classes in Canada, this article explores how adult job seekers experience e-recruitment platforms, examining promises of efficiency, convenience and fairness in light of embedded inequalities within algorithmic agencies. Located within constructs of digital inequality, new literacy studies and sociomaterial literacies, findings suggest the need to reconfigure skills discourses, literacy measurement projects, and literacies education to account for automated intelligences as new actors in the literacies landscape. \u00a9 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

These algorithms are the result of a long line of research into computational and predictive algorithms that track social media practices and uses them to infer individual characteristics and make psychometric assessments. Although it is now computationally possible, these algorithms are not widely known or understood by the general public. Little is known about how people would respond to them, particularly when they do not even know their online activities are being assessed by the algorithm. This study examines how people construct \u201csnap\u201d folk theories about the ways personality algorithms operate as well as how they react when shown their outputs. Through qualitative interviews (n = 37) with people after being presented with their own profile, this study identifies a series of folk theories that people came up with to explain the personality algorithm across four dimensions (data source, scope, collection process, and outputs). In addition, this study examined how those folk theories contributed to certain reactions, fears, and justifications people had about the algorithm. This study builds on our theoretical understanding of folk theory literature as well as certain limitations of algorithmic transparency/sovereignty when these types of inferential and predictive algorithms get coupled with people\u2019s hopes and fears about employment, hiring, and promotion. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2021.",

Biased algorithms were shown to negatively affect access to loans, hiring processes, judicial decisions, and more. Thus, studying workers' ability to balance reliance on algorithmic recommendations and critical judgment towards them, holds immense importance and potential social gain. In this study, we focused on gig-economy platform workers (MTurk) and simple perceptual judgment tasks, in which algorithmic mistakes are relatively visible. In a series of experiments, we present workers with misleading advice perceived to be the results of AI calculations and measure their conformity to the erroneous recommendations. Our initial results indicate that such algorithmic recommendations hold strong persuasive power, even compared to recommendations that are presented as crowd-based. Our study also explores the effectiveness of mechanisms for reducing workers' conformity in these situations. \u00a9 ICIS 2020. All rights reserved.",

    "abstract": "Examples of discriminatory algorithmic recruitment of workers have triggered a debate on application of the non-discrimination principle in the EU. Algorithms challenge two principles in the system of evidence in EU non-discrimination law. The first is effectiveness, given that due to algorithmic opacity, the parties in algorithmic discrimination cases do not have easy and unrestricted access to facts enabling them to support their claims. The second is fairness, insofar as the launching and unfolding of the evidentiary debate requires lifting the veil of algorithmic opacity: a colossal task, placing unrealistic burdens of proof on claimants and respondents. Algorithmic discrimination thus seems impossible to prove and, consequently, falls outside the scope of application of EU non-discrimination law. Two possible solutions are proposed. First, as regards effectiveness, a right to access evidence in favour of victims of algorithmic discrimination should be recognized, through a joint reading of EU non-discrimination law and the General Data Protection Regulation. Second, to allocate the burden of proof more proportionately, an extension of the grounds for defence ofrespondents could allow them to establish that biases were autonomously developed by an algorithm. \u00a9 2021.

However, job seekers often hesitate to trust AI-based recommendations in this context given the far-reaching consequences of the importance of the decision for a job on their future career and life. This hesitation is largely driven by a lack of explainability, as underlying algorithms are complex and not clear to the user. Prior research suggests that anthropomorphization (i.e., the attribution of human traits) can increase the acceptance of technology. Therefore, we adapted this concept for AI-based recommender systems and conducted a survey-based study with 120 participants. We find that that using an anthropomorphic design in a recommender system for open positions increases job seekers' acceptance of the underlying system. However, algorithm aversion rises if detailed information on the algorithmic origin is being disclosed. \u00a9 ICIS 2020. All rights reserved.",

Current knowledge about the threats of unfairness and (implicit) discrimination by algorithmic decision-making is mostly unexplored in the human resource management context. Our goal is to clarify the current state of research related to HR recruitment and HR development, identify research gaps, and provide crucial future research directions. Based on a systematic review of 36 journal articles from 2014 to 2020, we present some applications of algorithmic decision-making and evaluate the possible pitfalls in these two essential HR functions. In doing this, we inform researchers and practitioners, offer important theoretical and practical implications, and suggest fruitful avenues for future research. \u00a9 2020, The Author(s).",

    "abstract": "Employee performance monitoring is not new. Traditional systems consider an average of peer and direct supervisor reviews across various subjective criteria in yearly performance appraisals. This leads to problems such as recency and social biases that devalue the credibility of the review process. Modern, data-driven systems have made it easier to automatically track employee data regarding various common performance metrics in useful ways. Statistical measures are derived from these metrics that are collated over a defined period. These measures are used to determine if and when any appropriate action needs to be taken. However, the statistics fail to account for common characteristics of the employee population. Instead of comparing individual performance against rigid idealistic norms, this paper presents an automated and objective approach to determine the collective population norm and calculate abnormal deviations from it. Employees who deviate from the norm are automatically flagged and subject to further review from management. Ideally, a combination of calculated metrics using this approach can be used to accurately reflect real-world situations and highlight anomalies in the employee work force. We compare the results of the proposed statistical approach with traditional human review approaches and evaluate their correlation. \u00a9 2020 IEEE.",

It reports the findings from a series of interviews with senior HRD practitioners which identified five themes (emerging awareness; responding; division between IT and HRD; the role of HRD; and ethical implications) that are shared and explored. This chapter suggests that machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) are still something of a black box for HRD/LD and this enquiry prompted speculation and possibilities with an emerging recognition of the need to be involved and develop a more collaborative response. It argues that HRD/LD can make this happen and is important to the continuity, relevance and survival of the profession. \u00a9 Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020. All rights reserved.",

    "abstract": "Ranking algorithms based on Neural Networks have been a topic of recent research. Ranking is employed in everyday applications like product recommendations, search results, or even in finding good candidates for hiring. However, Neural Networks are mostly opaque tools, and it is hard to evaluate why a specific candidate, for instance, was not considered. Therefore, for neural-based ranking methods to be trustworthy, it is crucial to guarantee that the outcome is fair and that the decisions are not discriminating people according to sensitive attributes such as gender, sexual orientation, or ethnicity.In this work we present a family of fair pairwise learning to rank approaches based on Neural Networks, which are able to produce balanced outcomes for underprivileged groups and, at the same time, build fair representations of data, i.e. new vectors having no correlation with regard to a sensitive attribute. We compare our approaches to recent work dealing with fair ranking and evaluate them using both relevance and fairness metrics. Our results show that the introduced fair pairwise ranking methods compare favorably to other methods when considering the fairness/relevance trade-off. \u00a9 2020 IEEE.",

Algorithms have created opportunities for increasing fairness by overcoming biases commonly displayed by human decision makers. However, while HR algorithms may remove human bias in decision making, we argue that those being evaluated may perceive the process as reductionistic, leading them to think that certain qualitative information or contextualization is not being taken into account. We argue that this can undermine their beliefs about the procedural fairness of using HR algorithms to evaluate performance by promoting the assumption that decisions made by algorithms are based on less accurate information than identical decisions made by humans. Results from four laboratory experiments (N = 798) and a large-scale randomized experiment in an organizational setting (N = 1654) confirm this hypothesis.

    "abstract": "Purpose: The technological evolution of job interviews continues as highly automated interviews emerge as alternative approaches. Initial evidence shows that applicants react negatively to such interviews. Additionally, there is emerging evidence that contextual influences matter when investigating applicant reactions to highly automated interviews. However, previous research has ignored higher-level organizational contexts (i.e. which kind of organization uses the selection procedure) and individual differences (e.g. work experience) regarding applicant reactions. The purpose of this paper is to investigate applicant reactions to highly automated interviews for students and employees and the role of the organizational context when using such interviews. Design/methodology/approach: In a 2 \u00d7 2 online study, participants read organizational descriptions of either an innovative or an established organization and watched a video displaying a highly automated or a videoconference interview. Afterwards, participants responded to applicant reaction items. Findings: Participants (n=148) perceived highly automated interviews as more consistent but as conveying less social presence. The negative effect on social presence diminished organizational attractiveness. The organizational context did not affect applicant reactions to the interview approaches, whereas differences between students and employees emerged but only affected privacy concerns to the interview approaches. Research limitations/implications: The organizational context seems to have negligible effects on applicant reactions to technology-enhanced interviews. There were only small differences between students and employees regarding applicant reactions. Practical implications: In a tense labor market, hiring managers need to be aware of a trade-off between efficiency and applicant reactions regarding technology-enhanced interviews. Originality/value: This study investigates high-level contextual influences and individual differences regarding applicant reactions to highly automated interviews. \u00a9 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",

The under-representation of women, African-American and Latinx professionals in the IT workforce is a longstanding issue that contributes to and is impacted by algorithmic bias. Design/methodology/approach: Sources of algorithmic bias in talent acquisition software are presented. Feminist design thinking is presented as a theoretical lens for mitigating algorithmic bias. Findings: Data are just one tool for recruiters to use; human expertise is still necessary. Even well-intentioned algorithms are not neutral and should be audited for morally and legally unacceptable decisions. Feminist design thinking provides a theoretical framework for considering equity in the hiring decisions made by talent acquisition systems and their users. Social implications: This research implies that algorithms may serve to codify deep-seated biases, making IT work environments just as homogeneous as they are currently. If bias exists in talent acquisition software, the potential for propagating inequity and harm is far more significant and widespread due to the homogeneity of the specialists creating artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Originality/value: This work uses equity as a central concept for considering algorithmic bias in talent acquisition. Feminist design thinking provides a framework for fostering a richer understanding of what fairness means and evaluating how AI software might impact marginalized populations. \u00a9 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",

People analytics are said to allow decision-makers to make evidence-based, bias-free, and objective decisions, and expand workers' opportunities for personal and professional growth. Drawing on a virtue ethics approach, we argue that the use of people analytics in organizations can create a vicious cycle of ethical challenges - algorithmic opacity, datafication, and nudging - which limit people's ability to cultivate their virtue and flourish. We propose that organizations can mitigate these challenges and help workers develop their virtue by reframing people analytics as a fallible companion technology, introducing new organizational roles and practices, and adopting alternative technology design principles. We discuss the implications of this approach for organizations and for the design of people analytics, and propose directions for future research. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

    "abstract": "Concerns about online manipulation have centered on fears about undermining the autonomy of consumers and citizens. What has been overlooked is the risk that the same techniques of personalizing information online can also threaten equality. When predictive algorithms are used to allocate information about opportunities like employment, housing, and credit, they can reproduce past patterns of discrimination and exclusion in these markets. This Article explores these issues by focusing on the labor market, which is increasingly dominated by tech intermediaries. These platforms rely on predictive algorithms to distribute information about job openings, match job seekers with hiring firms, or recruit passive candidates. Because algorithms are built by analyzing data about past behavior, their predictions about who will make a good match for which jobs will likely reflect existing occupational segregation and inequality. When tech intermediaries cause discriminatory effects, they may be liable under Title VII, and Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act should not bar such actions. However, because of the practical challenges that litigants face in identifying and proving liability retrospectively, a more effective approach to preventing discriminatory effects should focus on regulatory oversight to ensure the fairness of algorithmic systems. \u00a9 2020 University of Virginia.

    "abstract": "Discriminatory practices in recruitment and hiring are an ongoing issue that is a concern not just for workplace relations, but also for wider understandings of economic justice and inequality. The ability to get and keep a job is a key aspect of participating in society and sustaining livelihoods. Yet the way decisions are made on who is eligible for jobs, and why, are rapidly changing with the advent and growth in uptake of automated hiring systems (AHSs) powered by data-driven tools. Evidence of the extent of this uptake around the globe is scarce, but a recent report estimated that 98% of Fortune 500 companies use Applicant Tracking Systems of some kind in their hiring process, a trend driven by perceived efficiency measures and cost-savings. Key concerns about such AHSs include the lack of transparency and potential limitation of access to jobs for specific profiles. In relation to the latter, however, several of these AHSs claim to detect and mitigate discriminatory practices against protected groups and promote diversity and inclusion at work. Yet whilst these tools have a growing user-base around the world, such claims of 'bias mitigation' are rarely scrutinised and evaluated, and when done so, have almost exclusively been from a US socio-legal perspective. In this paper, we introduce a perspective outside the US by critically examining how three prominent automated hiring systems (AHSs) in regular use in the UK, HireVue, Pymetrics and Applied, understand and attempt to mitigate bias and discrimination. These systems have been chosen as they explicitly claim to address issues of discrimination in hiring and, unlike many of their competitors, provide some information about how their systems work that can inform an analysis. Using publicly available documents, we describe how their tools are designed, validated and audited for bias, highlighting assumptions and limitations, before situating these in the socio-legal context of the UK. The UK has a very different legal background to the US in terms not only of hiring and equality law, but also in terms of data protection (DP) law. We argue that this might be important for addressing concerns about transparency and could mean a challenge to building bias mitigation into AHSs definitively capable of meeting EU legal standards. This is significant as these AHSs, especially those developed in the US, may obscure rather than improve systemic discrimination in the workplace. \u00a9 2020 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",

    "abstract": "The long-term impact of algorithmic decision making is shaped by the dynamics between the deployed decision rule and individuals' response. Focusing on settings where each individual desires a positive classification-including many important applications such as hiring and school admissions, we study a dynamic learning setting where individuals invest in a positive outcome based on their group's expected gain and the decision rule is updated to maximize institutional benefit. By characterizing the equilibria of these dynamics, we show that natural challenges to desirable long-term outcomes arise due to heterogeneity across groups and the lack of realizability. We consider two interventions, decoupling the decision rule by group and subsidizing the cost of investment. We show that decoupling achieves optimal outcomes in the realizable case but has discrepant effects that may depend on the initial conditions otherwise. In contrast, subsidizing the cost of investment is shown to create better equilibria for the disadvantaged group even in the absence of realizability. \u00a9 2020 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Yet, to date, little is known about how these methods are used in practice. How are algorithmic assessments built, validated, and examined for bias? In this work, we document and analyze the claims and practices of companies offering algorithms for employment assessment. In particular, we identify vendors of algorithmic pre-employment assessments (i.e., algorithms to screen candidates), document what they have disclosed about their development and validation procedures, and evaluate their practices, focusing particularly on efforts to detect and mitigate bias. Our analysis considers both technical and legal perspectives. Technically, we consider the various choices vendors make regarding data collection and prediction targets, and explore the risks and trade-offs that these choices pose. We also discuss how algorithmic de-biasing techniques interface with, and create challenges for, antidiscrimination law. \u00a9 2020 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

    "abstract": "Implicit bias is the unconscious attribution of particular qualities (or lack thereof) to a member from a particular social group (e.g., defined by gender or race). Studies on implicit bias have shown that these unconscious stereotypes can have adverse outcomes in various social contexts, such as job screening, teaching, or policing. Recently, [33] considered a mathematical model for implicit bias and showed the effectiveness of the Rooney Rule as a constraint to improve the utility of the outcome for certain cases of the subset selection problem. Here we study the problem of designing interventions for the generalization of subset selection - ranking - that requires to output an ordered set and is a central primitive in various social and computational contexts. We present a family of simple and interpretable constraints and show that they can optimally mitigate implicit bias for a generalization of the model studied by Kleinberg and Raghavan. Subsequently, we prove that under natural distributional assumptions on the utilities of items, simple, Rooney Rule-like, constraints can also surprisingly recover almost all the utility lost due to implicit biases. Finally, we augment our theoretical results with empirical findings on real-world distributions from the IIT-JEE (2009) dataset and the Semantic Scholar Research corpus. \u00a9 2020 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Researchers and practitioners in industrial-organizational psychology (IOP) and human resource management (HRM) can add significant value to big data and AI by offering their substantive expertise in how workforce-relevant data are measured and analyzed and how big data results are professionally, legally, and ethically interpreted and implemented by organizational decision makers, employees, policymakers, and other stakeholders in the employment arena. This article provides a perspective and framework for big data relevant to IOP and HRM that include both micro issues (e.g., linking data sources, decisions about which data to include, big data analytics) and macro issues (e.g., changing nature of big data, developing big data teams, educating professionals and graduate students, ethical and legal considerations). Ultimately, we strongly believe that IOP and HRM researchers and practitioners will become increasingly valuable for their contributions to the substance, technologies, algorithms, and communities that address big data, AI, and machine learning problems and applications in organizations relevant to their expertise. \u00a9 Copyright 2020 by Annual Reviews.

    "abstract": "Each decision-making, a fundamental human process, has been more and more supported by computer systems in the second part of the last century the so-called decision support systems (DSS). In the twenty-first century, intelligent decision support systems (IDSS) utilize artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to enhance and improve support for decision-makers. Ethics, as the branch of philosophy dealing with concepts of right and wrong conduct, was solely attributed to human intelligence, behaviour or decision. With artificial intelligence-based systems, the notion AI Ethics (or machine ethics) refers to ethical decision-making by machines. Specifically, in the field of IDSS, where AI techniques participate (at least partially) in the decision-making process, it is of utmost importance to design such systems with ethical considerations. In this paper, we present a classification of ethical values as an underlying concept for a framework consisting in a set of rules that need to be part of any IDSS design. Applied to a decision process for candidate pre-selection (e.g. hiring), we illustrate the pitfalls that lead to biased decisions and methods for mitigation of \u201cwrong decisions\u201d, from an ethical point of view. We suggest how to operationalize Ethics by Design and how to approach Ethics Build-In AI-based systems. \u00a9 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",

    "abstract": "Due to its large cost-saving potential, data-driven recruitment is becoming increasingly popular across various industries. However, several cases were reported where the use of corresponding technologies had caused systematic discrimination against certain candidate groups. While existing approaches to discover and prevent discrimination in data classification mostly perform well within a specific context, it remains unclear to what extent datadriven recruitment can be conducted discrimination-free in real-world business applications, where the respective context-specific assumptions do not necessarily hold. Hence, we first define a generic discrimination model that allows for arbitrary descriptions of job candidate characteristics, before applying two sophisticated discrimination-prevention algorithms on a sample data set generated from our model to evaluate the algorithms' performance. Our analysis shows that the amount of removed discrimination highly depends on the application context and its underlying definitions and assumptions, making it hard to provide a holistic answer to our research question. \u00a9 Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Business Information Systems 2020 \"Developments, Opportunities and Challenges of Digitization\", WIRTSCHAFTSINFORMATIK 2020.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in human resource management (HRM) in the Global South. Design/methodology/approach: Multiple case studies of AI tools used in HRM in these countries in recruiting and selecting as well as developing, retaining and productively utilizing employees have been used. Findings: With AI deployment in HRM, organizations can enhance efficiency in recruitment and selection and gain access to a larger recruitment pool. With AI deployment in HRM, subjective criteria such as nepotism and favoritism are less likely to come into play in recruitment and selection of employees. AI deployment in HRM also has a potentially positive impact on the development, retainment and productive utilization of employees. Research limitations/implications: AI is an evolving technology. Most HRM apps have not gained enough machine learning capabilities with real-world experience. Some of them lack a scientific basis. AI in HRM thus currently affects only a tiny proportion of the population in the GS. Practical implications: The paper explores the roles of AI in expanding recruitment pools. It also advances our understanding of how AI-based HIRM tools can help reduce biases in selecting candidates, which is especially important in the Global South. It also delves into various mechanisms by which AI helps in the development, retainment and productive utilization of employees. Originality/value: We provide details of various mechanisms by which AI brings input and output efficiencies in recruitment and selection in these countries. \u00a9 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",

Employee stress is harmful for both society (due to increased risk of mental health disorders and cardiovascular diseases) and for enterprise performance (due to increased risk of presenteeism, employee turnover and early retirement). This work aims at helping enterprises to improve employee wellbeing. To this end, we introduce a concept of IoT-based privacy-aware \u201cteam barometer\u201d and present a first study into using inexpensive PIR (passive infrared) motion detection sensors in such barometers. The study was conducted as follows: first, we deployed IoT system in real offices and collected employee data in the course of everyday work during several months. Second, we developed a machine learning method to classify human conditions on the basis of collected PIR data. In the tests, this method recognised employees\u2019 stress with 80% accuracy and dissatisfaction with indoor environmental quality - with 75% accuracy. Third, we integrated stress detection results into a \u201cteam barometer\u201d and conducted interviews of line managers. Interview results suggest that the proposed IoT-based team barometer can be beneficial for both employees and enterprises because of its potential to discover and mitigate workplace problems notably faster than with current practice to use periodic surveys. \u00a9 2020, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.",

    "abstract": "An oversized reliance on big data-driven algorithmic decision-making systems, coupled with a lack of critical inquiry regarding such systems, combine to create the paradoxical \u201cblack box\u201d at work. The \u201cblack box\u201d simultaneously demands a higher level of transparency from the worker in regard to data collection, while shrouding the decision-making in secrecy, making employer decisions even more opaque to the worker. To access employment, the worker is commanded to divulge highly personal information, and when hired, must submit further still to algorithmic processes of evaluations which will make authoritative claims as to the workers\u2019 productivity. Furthermore, in and out of the workplace, the worker is governed by an invisible data-created leash deploying wearable technology to collect intimate worker data. At all stages, the worker is confronted with a lack of transparency, accountability, or explanation as to the inner workings or even the logic of the \u201cblack box\u201d at work. This data revolution of the workplace is alarming for several reasons: (1) the \u201cblack box at work\u201d not only serves to conceal disparities in hiring, but could also allow for a level of \u201cdata-laundering\u201d that beggars any notion of equal opportunity in employment and (2) there exists, the danger of a \u201cmission creep\u201d attitude to data collection that allows for pervasive surveillance, contributing to the erosion of both the personhood and autonomy of workers. Thus, the \u201cblack box at work\u201d not only enables worker domination in the workplace, it deprives the worker of Rawlsian justice. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2020.",

    "abstract": "This paper aims at filling some gaps in the mainstream debate on automation and the future of work. This debate has concentrated, so far, on how many jobs will be lost as a consequence of technological innovation. This paper examines instead issues related to the quality of jobs in future labour markets. It addresses the detrimental effects on workers of awarding legal capacity and rights and obligation to robots. It examines the implications of practices such as People Analytics and the use of big data and artificial intelligence to manage the workforce. It stresses on an oft-neglected feature of the contract of employment, namely the fact that it vests the employer with authority and managerial prerogatives over workers. It points out that a vital function of labour law is to limit these authority and prerogatives to protect the human dignity of workers. It then highlights the benefits of human-rights based approaches to labour regulation to protect workers\u2019 privacy against invasive electronic monitoring. It concludes by highlighting the crucial role of collective regulation and social partners in governing automation and the impact of technology at the workplace. It stresses that collective dismissal regulation and the involvement of workers\u2019 representatives in managing and preventing job losses is crucial and that collective actors should actively participate in the governance of technology-enhanced management systems, to ensure a vital \u201chuman-in-command\u201d approach. \u00a9 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",

Organizations have formed specialized teams and software companies, are designing newest predictive systems to help HR with data extraction and understanding People Analytics. However, there are still a number of limitations reported in numerous studies, such as: data privacy and perception limitations hindering effective convergence of People Analytics into HR practices. This study holistically approaches the topic by critically reviewing and synthesizing the existing literature; by comparing region-wise business performance indicators to understand the role of People Analytics, performs content analysis on selected reports to identify perception level limitations of People Analytics, and finally generates correlated qualitative themes to address convergence limitations of People Analytics into HR practices. The study provides a Two-Tier solution validated through Content Analysis performed in the Nvivo. Data analysis shows emergence of two broad correlated themes-1) limitations at functional level and 2) limitations at normative (psychological) level. The study provides specific guidelines to HR practitioners and business researchers on how to overcome application limitations related to People Analytics within their organizations. \u00a9 2019 IEEE.",

    "abstract": "Over the past few years, machine learning and AI have become increasingly common in human resources (HR) applications, such as candidate screening, resume parsing, and employee attrition and turnover prediction. Though AI assists in making these tasks more efficient, and seemingly less biased through automation, it relies heavily on data created by humans, and consequently can have human biases carry over to decisions made by a model. Several studies have shown biases in machine learning applications such as facial recognition and candidate ranking. This has spurred active research on the topic of fairness in machine learning over the last five years. Several toolkits to mitigate biases and interpret black box models have been developed in an effort to promote fair algorithms. This paper presents an overview of fairness definitions, methods, and tools as they relate to recruitment and establishes ethical considerations in the use of machine learning in the hiring space. \u00a9 2019 IEEE.",

This makes it possible to profile workers automatically and even allows technology itself to replace human resources personnel in making decisions that have legal effects on employees (recruitment, promotion, dismissals, etc.). This entails great risks of worker discrimination and defencelessness, with workers unaware of the reasons underlying any such decision. This article analyses the protections established in the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for safeguarding employees against discrimination. One of the main conclusions that can be drawn is that, in the face of the inadequacy of the GDPR in the field of labour relations, there is a need for the collective governance of workplace data protection, requiring the participation of workers\u2019 representatives in establishing safeguards. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2019.",

Discrimination, envy, and indifference of colleagues do not have that much effect on talented employees' loyalty. Creation of more favorable labor conditions for talented employees is contradictory and predetermines the discontent of other corporate employees, which may result in conflicts, the ethnic ones inclusive.

Efficiency advantages exist, but it is unclear how people react to such interviews (and whether reactions depend on the stakes involved). Participants (N\u00a0=\u00a0123) in a 2 (highly automated, videoconference)\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02 (high-stakes, low-stakes situation) experiment watched and assessed videos depicting a highly automated interview for high-stakes (selection) and low-stakes (training) situations or an equivalent videoconference interview. Automated high-stakes interviews led to ambiguity and less perceived controllability. Additionally, highly automated interviews diminished overall acceptance through lower social presence and fairness. To conclude, people seem to react negatively to highly automated interviews and acceptance seems to vary based on the stakes.

However, the social impacts of using synchrony and AI decision agents in video interviews have not been investigated. Drawing on media richness theory and social interface theory, this study employed a novel experimental design to compare human ratings and job applicants' response behaviours between the SVI and AVI settings and compare job applicants\u2019 fairness perception between the AVI setting and the AVI setting using an AI decision agent (AVI-AI). The results from 180 observations revealed that 1) first impression and physical appearance significantly affected structured interview ratings regardless of whether the video interview was synchronous; 2) compared with SVIs, AVIs lessened the primacy effect on physical appearance and initial impression among human raters; 3) job applicants had indistinguishable fairness perceptions regarding synchrony (SVI vs. AVI) and decision agent (human vs. AI); and 4) applicants exhibited less favourability towards AVIs than towards SVIs. Findings from this experimental comparison, including recommendations for practice and future research on human resource selection, technology education, and social computing, are discussed. \u00a9 2019",

This article identifies four challenges in using data science techniques for HR tasks: complexity of HR phenomena, constraints imposed by small data sets, accountability questions associated with fairness and other ethical and legal constraints, and possible adverse employee reactions to management decisions via data-based algorithms. It then proposes practical responses to these challenges based on three overlapping principles\u2014 causal reasoning, randomization and experiments, and employee contribution\u2014 that would be both economically efficient and socially appropriate for using data science in the management of employees. \u00a9 The Regents of the University of California 2019.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: This paper aims to assess the increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI) and biometrics in monitoring employee performance and behavior and offer a perspective on the impact of this development on corporate culture and employee relations. Design/methodology/approach: The authors have reviewed a variety of new applications of AI technologies covered in the business literature and have offered a commentary on the impact. Findings: The authorshave found that the use of these technologies is viewed with suspicion if not outright alarm by employees. Some of these technologies appear so invasive that even vendors supplying them are at pains to ensure that true employee consent is obtained. Research limitations/implications: This is a selective and not a comprehensive view of the subject without additional primary research. Practical implications: Companies will have an increasingly important choice to make about the types of surveillance technologies they deploy with profound implications for the types of corporate culture that will emerge. Social implications: The authorshope that the review and discussion of the use of these technologies will prompt a broader social discussion about the use of AI and predictive analytics across a range of applications which will, in turn, lead to the adoption of common standards for privacy and transparency. Originality/value: While the technologies themselves have been written about in a variety of forums, it is believed that this is the first attempt, to the best of the author\u2019s knowledge, to survive the landscape of AI uses in HR. \u00a9 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",

Additionally, we quantify the bias that remains when these indicators are \u201cscrubbed,\u201d and describe proxy behavior that occurs in the absence of explicit gender indicators.

We trace how the notion of fairness has been defined within the testing communities of education and hiring over the past half century, exploring the cultural and social context in which different fairness definitions have emerged. In some cases, earlier definitions of fairness are similar or identical to definitions of fairness in current machine learning research, and foreshadow current formal work. In other cases, insights into what fairness means and how to measure it have largely gone overlooked. We compare past and current notions of fairness along several dimensions, including the fairness criteria, the focus of the criteria (e.g., a test, a model, or its use), the relationship of fairness to individuals, groups, and subgroups, and the mathematical method for measuring fairness (e.g., classification, regression). This work points the way towards future research and measurement of (un)fairness that builds from our modern understanding of fairness while incorporating insights from the past. \u00a9 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",

Therefore, automation of HRM is possible. In areas like recruitment and selection, this automation is already observable, with consequences like algorithmic discrimination. Consequently, it is essential to open the black box of automated HRM and be able to monitor the automated process loop and steer it strategically. However, this presupposes a unique set of skills. People require training in computational, statistical, and, most importantly, skeptical thinking. These skills are necessary at first in the HR department and later for the entire organization in order to escape the vicious cycle. This chapter shows the need for HRM in the digitized society to get the fullest potential out of big data and not become dependent on the reality that data will shape without human supervision. \u00a9 John Storm Pedersen and Adrian Wilkinson 2019.

In order to protect people\u2019s privacy and prevent discrimination, these decision-makers may choose to delete or avoid collecting social category data, like sex and race. In this article, we argue that such censoring can exacerbate discrimination by making biases more difficult to detect. We begin by detailing how computerized decisions can lead to biases in the absence of social category data and in some contexts, may even sustain biases that arise by random chance. We then show how proactively using social category data can help illuminate and combat discriminatory practices, using cases from education and employment that lead to strategies for detecting and preventing discrimination. We conclude that discrimination can occur in any sociotechnical system in which someone decides to use an algorithmic process to inform decision-making, and we offer a set of broader implications for researchers and policymakers. \u00a9 2018 Penn State University Press.

This is a critical problem because on the one hand, organizations who use but do not understand the discriminatory potential of such systems will facilitate the widening of social disparities under the assumption that algorithms are categorically objective. On the other hand, the responsible use of machine learning can help us measure, understand, and mitigate the implicit historical biases in socially sensitive data by expressing implicit decision-making mental models in terms of explicit statistical models.

In order to protect people's privacy and prevent discrimination, these decision-makers may choose to delete or avoid collecting social category data, like sex and race. In this article, we argue that such censoring can exacerbate discrimination by making biases more difficult to detect. We begin by detailing how computerized decisions can lead to biases in the absence of social category data and in some contexts, may even sustain biases that arise by random chance. We then show how proactively using social category data can help illuminate and combat discriminatory practices, using cases from education and employment that lead to strategies for detecting and preventing discrimination. We conclude that discrimination can occur in any sociotechnical system in which someone decides to use an algorithmic process to inform decision-making, and we offer a set of broader implications for researchers and policymakers. \u00a9 2018 Penn State University Press.

Our ranked group fairness definition extends group fairness using the standard notion of protected groups and is based on ensuring that the proportion of protected candidates in every prefix of the top-k ranking remains statistically above or indistinguishable from a given minimum. Utility is operationalized in two ways: (i) every candidate included in the top-k should be more qualified than every candidate not included; and (ii) for every pair of candidates in the top-k, the more qualified candidate should be ranked above. An efficient algorithm is presented for producing the Fair Top-k Ranking, and tested experimentally on existing datasets as well as new datasets released with this paper, showing that our approach yields small distortions with respect to rankings that maximize utility without considering fairness criteria. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm grounded in statistical tests that can mitigate biases in the representation of an under-represented group along attranked list. \u00a9 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Organizations, looking for new ways to collect and harness big data, are scouring the Internet in search of untapped outlets of information about job applicants and automated ways to use social media for recruiting and selection, and are using analytics on their internal big data generated by internal social media and intranets to improve their performance management systems and internal processes.

Their objective is often to become more objective and get away from human limitation, such as implicit biases versus underprivileged groups of people. In this explorative analysis there have been three potential problems identified, regarding the practice of using these predictive computer tools for hiring. First, that they might miss the best candidates, as the employed algorithms are tuned with limited and outdated data. Second, is the risk of directly or indirectly discriminate candidates, or, third, failure to give equal opportunities for all individuals. The problems are not new to us, and from this theoretical analysis and from other similar work; it seems that algorithms and predictive data mining tools have similar kinds of implicit biases as humans. Our human limitations, then, does not seem to be limited to us humans. \u00a9 IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2016.",

Design/methodology/approach: The author uses an audit of numerous secondary sources to identify common themes and distinctive impacts of the uses of algorithms. Findings: This research determined that perverse and unintended consequences of the spread of algorithm-driven decision-making were pervasive. Research Limitations/implications: Based on a review of secondary resources, data on the impact of the algorithms is of necessity primarily anecdotal. Practical Implications: The research shows that the pervasive inequities produced by algorithm-driven decision-making represents a very significant reputation risk and a potential flashpoint for many different organizations. Social Implications: If algorithm-driven decision-making indeed entrenches racism and other inequities, it is critical for society that we find an effective way to regulate their use. Originality/value: While considerable attention has been devoted to individual instances of inequities produced by algorithm-driven decision-making, we believe this is one of the first reviews to look across the spectrum of applications from a reputation risk perspective. \u00a9 2016, \u00a9 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",

In practice, there are many possible errors or biases in the performance appraisal process. These errors affect the objectivity of the appraisal to a large extent. The most common errors in appraisal include the Halo Effect and Horn Effect, leniency Error (Loose rater), the Error of Strictness (Tight rater), the Central Tendency Error, the Recency Effect, the Contrast Error and the Similarity (similar-to-me) Effect. The aim of this research project is to develop an intelligent IT system to address the issues of existing employee appraisal system. The system would be seamless and reduce human intervention to minimal. The system can be realized as a dashboard. Outcome of this research can be applied in today's businesses. The design of the system mentioned here is a process to ensure that the rater bias is limited. This type of system would be more beneficial for larger organizations with thousands of employees. A limitation could be that this type of application can be overhead for small companies. \u00a9 Copyright 2015, IGI Global.",

Although these innovations improve efficiency and decision-making, they also generate ethical challenges related to data privacy, algorithmic bias, transparency, and employee monitoring. This article examines the role of professional ethics in HRM within the context of digital transformation, highlighting both emerging challenges and potential opportunities. This study employs a conceptual research approach supported by a comprehensive literature review of scholarly works on HRM, professional ethics, and digitalization. The analysis focuses on core ethical principles such as integrity, fairness, responsibility, professionalism, and confidentiality, and evaluates their implementation in digital HR practices. The findings indicate that unethical use of digital technologies may lead to discrimination, reduced employee trust, and violations of individual rights, particularly through biased AI-based recruitment systems and opaque performance evaluation mechanisms. However, digital transformation also offers opportunities to strengthen ethical HR governance. The use of ethical data management, algorithmic audits, digital transparency, and e-learning-based ethics training can enhance accountability and fairness in HR processes. The study concludes that integrating professional ethics with digital HRM is essential for developing human-centered, sustainable, and trustworthy organizations in the digital era.",

While energy practitioners viewed AI as a promising tool for reducing bias in safety analysis, educators were more skeptical, emphasizing challenges around transparency, creativity, and contextual judgment. This paper introduces the Responsible AI Competence Assessment (RAICA) framework to address these governance gaps. RAICA extends the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) through the addition of ethical trust, algorithmic fairness, and sector-sensitive validation metrics. Furthermore, the framework translates abstract policy instruments into actionable operational protocols, including mandates for bias auditing and algorithmic explainability. The proposed framework provides a flexible and practical governance template for high-stakes decision-making across diverse sectors by bridging efficiency and ethical accountability.",

The application of AI in HRM offers opportunities to increase organizational effectiveness, but also raises challenges related to transparency, algorithmic bias, and ethics in workforce management. Therefore, this research was conducted to explore the impact of AI in HRM and how organizations can optimize its use. This research uses a literature review method, by examining various scientific sources related to the implementation of AI in HRM. The study was conducted on articles from academic journals, industry reports, and related publications that discuss the role of AI in the recruitment process, performance evaluation, employee training, and strategic decision making. The research results show that AI can improve HRM efficiency through automation of administrative tasks, predictive analytics, and personalization of the employee experience. However, the main challenges found include algorithmic bias, lack of transparency in AI systems, and legal and regulatory uncertainty. In conclusion, AI has great potential in supporting more effective and data-driven HRM, but its use must be accompanied by policies that ensure transparency, accountability and a balance between automation and the role of humans in decision making. Therefore, a careful approach is needed in adopting AI to ensure maximum benefits without compromising aspects of ethics and fairness.",

This paper aims to investigate the effect of organizational size and HR roles on AI technology adoption in recruitment process, with a special reference to IT companies in Bengaluru. The research hopes to offer guidance on how organizations can maximize the potential of AI in their HR by exploring how AI utilities including Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS), chatbots and predictive analytics influence time-to-hire, candidate experience and recruitment efficiency. It also discusses ethics implications of AI deployment, including aspects such as algorithmic bias and employee data privacy.\nThe results show that larger companies are more likely to adopt AI for recruiting because of their financial resources and infrastructure. In addition, HR Managers are key contributors to AI adoption, given their participation in making strategic decisions and greater access to the necessary tools/ skills to successfully apply. The report reveals that the promise of AI is being realized to deliver operational efficiencies, yet these benefits are accompanied by concerns about fairness and transparency in AI decisions, and about potential risk and bias in AI algorithms.\nThis study adds to the emerging body of knowledge on AI in HR with its investigation of the impact of underlined organization size and HR role on AI adoption in recruitment, theoretical and practical implications for organizations seeking to introduce AI in recruitment and ethical challenges are presented. The research also adds another voice to the chorus of those highlighting the importance of human-in-the-loop review before decisions are acted upon by an AI tool, so that it support company values and enables fair recruitment steps.",

Research using primary qualitative data from semi structured interviews identifies themes related to AI in deployment recruitment, employee performance management, ethical issues, employee re\u2010skilling and HRs evolving role. Results show organizations using AI tools to boost operational efficiency and decision making, but issues such as algorithmic bias, lacking transparency, ambiguous ethics and limited digital literacy within HR teams remain considerable. The study also points out sectoral disparities in AI readiness and organizational support that make AI prepared for successful SHRM transformation not solely technological infrastructure but an ethical governance, collaboration across functions and foresight. The paper contributes to the emerging discourse on human centered AI by interpreting these findings through a multidisciplinary lens, also arguing that this kind of balance in technological innovation needs to optimize for employee wellbeing and organizational values.

Although, it should be noted that AI has a specific character side away from other technology. Publications covering this knowledge area have grown sharply, however the scholarly covering the impact of AI bias inHRM is scarce. This paper studies this area and goes deeper to explore the future research areas by conducting a systematic literature review for 598 papers from Scopes and Emerald insight databases of which 34 articles were selected after implementing the PRISMA tool and quality evaluation stage. Results generated revealed that biased AI applications are negatively affecting performance management, compensation, staffing and training and development. Apart from that future research domains and questions have been outlined and identified from organizations\u2019 and employees\u2019 perspectives.",

This systematic literature review employs the PRISMA method to synthesise findings from 78 peer-reviewed articles published between 2018 and 2025. AI is making recruitment more efficient, supporting personalized learning, and improving workplace analytics. Still, there are ongoing concerns about transparency, fairness, data privacy, and employee trust. Thematic analysis points to four main trends: better recruitment, more tailored learning, performance evaluations supported by algorithms, and higher employee engagement. While there has been progress, research shows that ethical and governance frameworks are still lacking, especially for long-term employee welfare and sustainable HR management. This study suggests a human-centered approach that balances technical efficiency with inclusivity, equity, and sustainability. The review aims to help both academics and managers by outlining current challenges, identifying gaps, and suggesting directions for future research.",

The purpose of the study is to confirm that artificial intelligence does not replace humans but rather enhances their role through the model of predictive empathy. Based on data from a survey of 698 organizations across nine Central and Eastern European countries, the following findings were identified: a) the integration of AI tools increases the accuracy and transparency of HR processes while maintaining a focus on the individual and human values; b) organizations applying the HR 5.0 approach demonstrate higher levels of employee trust, a better perception of fairness, and greater decision-making efficiency. A strategic framework for implementing human-centric AI solutions in HR is proposed, along with the stages of introducing the predictive-empathic model through the formation of a three-level system of technological, organizational, and social trust, ensuring digital transformation accompanied by ethical and organizational-cultural changes. It is concluded that digitalization and AI do not eliminate the human factor but rather create conditions for a new ethics of management. The obtained results can be recommended for developing corporate digital transformation strategies aimed at building sustainable and ethically responsible HR systems, supporting the transition to the HR 5.0 model.",

    "abstract": "The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Human Resource Management (HRM) is revolutionising workforce management by automating recruitment, performance evaluations, and employee engagement processes. However, AI-driven HRM systems raise critical ethical concerns, particularly regarding bias, privacy, and transparency. This study explores the ethical implications of AI adoption in HRM, with a specific focus on the power sector, where automation plays a crucial role in workforce optimisation. The research employs a quantitative approach, analysing responses from 250 employees across various departments in power sector organisations. Using SPSS, key statistical tests\u2014including factor analysis, correlation, regression, and ANOVA\u2014are applied to examine the relationships between AI bias, privacy concerns, transparency, employee trust, and job satisfaction. Findings reveal that AI bias significantly affects workforce diversity, while privacy concerns negatively impact employee trust in AI-driven HR decisions. Moreover, the study highlights that greater transparency in AI decision-making fosters higher employee satisfaction and engagement. The study underscores the need for organisations to implement ethical AI governance frameworks to ensure fair, unbiased, and privacy-compliant AI systems in HRM. It recommends explainable AI models, fairness audits, and hybrid decision-making (AI + human oversight) to enhance trust and acceptance of AI-driven HR practices. These findings contribute to the broader discourse on responsible AI adoption in HRM, offering strategic insights for HR leaders, policymakers, and AI developers in the power sector.",

    "abstract": "The impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on human resources management (HRM) is profound, driving major shifts in how organizations approach workforce management. AI is fundamentally changing key HR processes such as recruitment, performance management, employee development, and HR administration. In the recruitment space, AI-powered tools can automate the initial stages of hiring, streamlining tasks like resume screening and interview scheduling. These technologies are able to analyze large pools of applicants, matching their qualifications and skills to the job requirements. This can lead to faster, more accurate hiring decisions and help organizations build diverse, high-performing teams. However, there is a potential risk that biases embedded in the data used by AI systems could reinforce inequalities, making it crucial for companies to ensure that their AI tools are regularly audited for fairness and inclusivity.\n\nIn performance management, AI is transforming how employees are evaluated and developed. Traditional performance reviews can often be subjective and inconsistent, but AI can introduce a more objective and data-driven approach. By continuously tracking key performance indicators (KPIs) and employee behaviors, AI can provide real-time insights into performance trends, identify potential areas of improvement, and even predict future challenges. This enables HR professionals to tailor development plans for individual employees, fostering personal growth and enhancing overall productivity. However, the reliance on AI for performance evaluation raises concerns about employee privacy and the potential for over-monitoring, highlighting the need for clear ethical guidelines and transparency in how data is collected and used.",

Through automation and predictive analytics, AI assists HR professionals in recruitment, performance evaluation, training, and employee engagement. However, while the potential of AI is vast, its integration into HRM presents several strategic challenges. Ethical dilemmas, data privacy risks, algorithmic bias, and the potential for employee displacement or resistance are significant barriers to effective implementation. Moreover, the rapid advancement of AI technologies demands continuous upskilling and reskilling of HR personnel to ensure technological adaptability. \nThis paper examines these multifaceted strategic challenges by drawing insights from contemporary literature and qualitative research findings across different organizational contexts. It further investigates how organizations can align AI adoption with ethical governance frameworks, transparent communication, and employee inclusion strategies. \nThe findings suggest that sustainable AI integration in HRM requires balancing technological efficiency with human-centric values to maintain trust, fairness, and inclusivity. In conclusion, the paper emphasizes the importance of responsible innovation, where AI tools are leveraged not merely for automation but as catalysts for strategic transformation in HR practices. By fostering a culture of learning and ethical awareness, organizations can harness AI\u2019s full potential while mitigating its associated risks.",

    "abstract": "Driven by artificial intelligence technology, human resource management is undergoing a digital transformation. The central contradiction lies in the dynamic interplay between technological empowerment and humanistic values. This study focuses on the dual impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on employee experience within human resource management (HRM). It aims to systematically analyze how AI technologies facilitate the enhancement and optimization of employee experience during HRM processes, while simultaneously revealing their potential technological paradox and experience depletion. It reveals that: the application of AI technology demonstrates significant effectiveness in enhancing recruitment efficiency, personalizing employee training, and increasing the objectivity of performance management. At the same time, issues such as algorithmic bias, black-box decision-making, and excessive monitoring may trigger a crisis of trust. Consequently, this study advances the proposition that, the key issue in the digital transformation of enterprise human resource management lies in continuously building a dynamic framework of\u201chuman intelligence collaboration\u201d, seeking an appropriate balance between technological rationality and human needs/dignity, and between efficiency gains and humanistic care, thereby ensuring that the application of artificial intelligence centers on human beings.",

    "abstract": "\"The research purpose is to explore the ethical implications of AI integration in HRM practices and its potential contribution to sustainable development. Research motivation: The rapid advancement of AI has brought forth numerous opportunities and challenges in HRM, including privacy concerns, bias, and discrimination. However, AI also has the potential to foster a culture of ethics and sustainability in organizations, and to address non-traditional security challenges and promote economic self-reliance. Research design, approach, and method: This paper will conduct a literature review of the latest research on AI in HRM and its ethical implications. The review will examine the relationship between AI and the ethical dimensions of HRM, such as privacy, surveillance, bias, and discrimination. It will also discuss the role of AI in fostering a culture of ethics and sustainability within organizations, and how it can be utilized to address non-traditional security challenges and promote an independent and self-reliant economy. Main findings: AI in HRM raises significant ethical concerns, including privacy and surveillance concerns, the potential for bias and discrimination, and the risk of over-reliance on AI at the expense of human judgment. AI has the potential to contribute significantly to sustainable development by optimizing resource allocation, improving efficiency, and facilitating decision-making processes. It can also foster a culture of ethics and sustainability within organizations and address non-traditional security challenges. However, the potential negative impacts of AI on sustainable development, such as its significant energy consumption and the risk of job displacement, should not be overlookedPractical/managerial implications: To harness the potential of AI in HRM while mitigating its risks, it is crucial to establish best practices and guidelines for its ethical use. These should include defining clear goals and objectives for AI implementation, involving stakeholders in the process, ensuring data quality, continuously monitoring and evaluating AIdriven processes, and addressing ethical considerations. Organizations must also carefully consider and address the challenges of implementing AI in HRM, such as data privacy concerns, algorithmic bias, ethical considerations, resistance to change, integration with existing systems, ensuring AI complements human decision-making, legal and regulatory compliance, and skills gap.\"",

    "abstract": "The rapid integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into Human Resource Management (HRM) has redefined the traditional boundaries of workforce administration, talent acquisition, and employee engagement. As organizations increasingly rely on algorithmic systems for decision-making, the convergence of technological efficiency and ethical responsibility has emerged as a pivotal concern within modern management discourse. This research explores the multifaceted role of AI in reshaping HR functions through a multidisciplinary lens, combining insights from management science, behavioral psychology, data ethics, and organizational sociology. The study examines how AI-driven tools such as predictive analytics for recruitment, natural language processing in performance evaluation, and automated sentiment analysis for employee well-being have enhanced operational precision and strategic decision-making in HRM. Methodologically, the research employs a mixed approach, synthesizing empirical case studies, policy reviews, and theoretical frameworks to evaluate both the efficiency gains and ethical complexities arising from AI adoption. Findings indicate that AI significantly reduces administrative redundancy, enhances predictive accuracy in workforce planning, and enables a more data-driven understanding of employee behavior. However, these advancements are counterbalanced by profound ethical and social challenges, including algorithmic bias, loss of transparency, privacy intrusions, and the erosion of human discretion in evaluative processes. The analysis reveals that while AI augments managerial capabilities, its unregulated application risks transforming human resources into mere data entities, thereby undermining the human-centric foundations of employment relations. The paper argues that a sustainable integration of AI in HRM must reconcile the competing imperatives of efficiency and ethics through an adaptive governance framework. This includes instituting algorithmic accountability, transparent data management policies, and cross-disciplinary collaboration between technologists, ethicists, and HR professionals. Furthermore, the study emphasizes the importance of cultivating digital literacy and ethical awareness among HR practitioners to ensure that AI complements rather than replaces human judgment. Ultimately, the research contributes to the growing discourse on responsible AI by demonstrating that technological progress in HRM must be guided not only by efficiency metrics but also by normative principles that preserve fairness, dignity, and inclusivity in the workplace. It calls for a paradigm shift toward a balanced, ethically informed, and human-centered approach to managing the future of work. \n\u00a0",

This literature review explores how AI-driven tools such as machine learning, predictive analytics, and digital automation are being applied to core HR functions including burnout detection, pay equity analysis, performance evaluation, scheduling, and turnover prediction. With burnout rates rising and equity gaps persisting, particularly in mission-driven environments, AI presents an opportunity to deliver data-informed, scalable interventions that improve employee well-being and organizational fairness. The review highlights key benefits of AI integration, including administrative efficiency, reduced bias, improved decision-making, and early intervention capabilities. It also critically examines ethical challenges related to algorithmic bias, transparency, employee privacy, and the potential dehumanization of workplace interactions. Drawing on case studies, regulatory guidance, and emerging research, the manuscript proposes a roadmap for ethical AI implementation tailored to the values of social impact organizations. The recommendations emphasize human oversight, stakeholder inclusion, AI literacy, and privacy safeguards. The analysis concludes that AI\u2019s role in HR should be augmentative\u2014amplifying human empathy and institutional integrity. When guided by equitable frameworks, AI-enabled HR systems can not only mitigate existing workplace inequities but also build more resilient, inclusive, and sustainable workforces across healthcare and nonprofit sectors. \nKeywords: Artificial Intelligence, Burnout Prevention, Compensation Equity, Workforce Optimization, Human Resource Technology, Nonprofit Organizations, Healthcare Workforce, Predictive Analytics, Ethical AI, HH Innovation.",

Organizations competing for talent together with employee experience needs achieve measurable decision-making and workforce outcome advantages through AI HR analytics implementation. \n\nMethods: A total of 100 HR professionals from technology and finance sectors as well as retail and healthcare and manufacturing industries participated in the research. The data collection process used a structured questionnaire to assess AI implementation stages and usage locations together with participant views on benefits and implementation hurdles. Quantitative data underwent descriptive statistical analysis while qualitative information helped explain implementation barriers and ethical concerns.\n\nResults: Organizations that apply AI-driven HR analytics achieve significant performance improvements. The recruitment process became 20\u201335% more efficient while the time for hiring shortened drastically and candidate assessment quality improved by 30%. Employee engagement scores showed an 18% increase and voluntary attrition rates dropped by 25%. Organizations which implemented AI-based performance monitoring systems managed to identify employees who needed retention the most thus enhancing their targeted retention approaches. Survey participants pointed out three main obstacles which included data privacy problems (62%), algorithmic bias (48%) and implementation expenses (41%).\n\nConclusion: The successful adoption of technology demands organizations to combine its functional aspects with moral standards which protect equality along with open operations and confidence building.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the application of artificial intelligence in Human Resource Management (HRM) has created efficiencies. Also, there are significant challenges with transparency, fairness and ethical accountability in decisionmaking. Therefore, this manuscript introduces CalibHRM, a Feedback-Calibrated Ethical Decision Framework, utilizing the Throughput Model (TPM) for ethically-relevant and adaptive HRM decision processes. Specifically, the framework is designed across five structured processes, initially the data collection and normalization of employee HR records, performance management assessments and employee feedback, Subsequently, ethical pathway encoding performs the ethical moral reasoning models based on six TPM models. Consequently, calculating the Ethical Balance Score (EBS) to effectively characterize fairness, satisfaction, bias, and accuracy. Further, a Feedback Calibration Cycle (FCC) is utilized which rehabilitates the power of ethical pathways on the basis of changes in EBS as compared to a target. Additionally, the proposed CalibHRM uses a lightweight recalibrative mechanism of adjustments within algorithm-assisted HRM decisions that continuously reinforces and aligns ethical and organizational values with decision-making. Experimental validation is provided through the assessment of HR decision dataset to demonstrate how CalibHRM strengthens ethics balance, reduces bias factors, and provides a transparent framework for interpretative explanation and decision-making for characteristics aligned with fairness-angled HRM. The proposed CalibHRM model obtained high results in terms of Mean Error (ME) and Standard Deviation Error (SDE) of 20.65 and 4.49 respectively.",

This research develops an elaborate strategy which utilizes Artificial Intelligence (AI) to transform Human Resource Management (HRM) capabilities in talent recruitment and employee engagement for contemporary enterprises. The proposed system improves both recruitment speed and workforce contentment through its integration of machine learning algorithms along with natural language processing (NLP) and reinforcement learning methods with traditional HR practices. The employment of NLP techniques during resume evaluation produced results that surpassed human screening with a measurement accuracy of 92.3%. XGBoost based predictive candidate-job fit analysis reached 89.6% accuracy in its assessment of organizational-demand and candidate-profile compatibility. The interpretation of employee feedback from different departments reached an 88.4% accuracy through LSTM models for sentiment analysis. The deployment of AI engagement monitoring technology resulted in a 34.4% average increase of employee engagement scores following implementation. The AI recommendation system received employee acceptance in 60.3% of cases according to its recorded data. The analyzed data shows that artificial intelligence offers organizations opportunities to optimize HR operations and decrease bias while making better data-based workforce decisions. Research findings indicate that artificial intelligence serves beyond being a supportive tool because it becomes a strategic partner for human capital management in digital environments.",

The study evaluated the challenges faced while adopting AI in HRM to enhance firms\u2019 data transformation processes. The study adopted a quantitative research design and surveys for data collection. A random sampling approach was used to select 169 companies in Jordan, with 200 employees chosen. A multiple regression model (MRM) was used to assess the impact of challenges on AI adoption. The study revealed that data falsification and biased decision-making are the most pervasive challenges, while firm long-term budgeting has been facilitated. The study concludes that adopting AI in HRM results in unfair decision-making and invalidated results. Further financial maintenance is also a factor sufficiently provided by the innovative AI techniques applied in the recruitment process (Jihad & V\u00e1rallyai, 2021; Prikshat et al., 2023). The Jordanian context, which is culturally distinct from the rest of the globe, has not had its AI-related challenges well addressed. This research addresses a gap in the literature by describing the challenges faced by human resource (HR) managers in Jordan when attempting to integrate AI and by proposing a solution to these problems.",

The rapid development of AI technologies makes their application in HR not only a technological but also a managerial challenge that requires systematic approaches and effective governance mechanisms.\nThe goal of this research is to identify key areas of artificial intelligence application in personnel management, analyze their advantages and risks, and determine the conditions for effective implementation in organizational practice.\nThe study is based on a systematic review of scientific sources and analytical reports of international organizations in the field of human resource management and digital innovation. Methods of structural-logical analysis, comparison, classification, and synthesis were applied to identify the main directions of AI use. Empirical examples of AI implementation in recruitment, performance management, training, and employee well-being programs were analyzed. Attention was paid to regulatory approaches, ethical frameworks, and standards that guide the responsible use of AI in HR.\nThe research identifies several core areas of AI application in personnel management. First, AI is widely used in recruitment and selection through automated candidate screening, resume analysis, and predictive assessment of job fit. These tools reduce the time and cost of hiring, although they require careful control to avoid algorithmic bias. Second, AI supports performance management by analyzing work patterns, productivity indicators, and behavioral data to provide objective feedback. Third, AI contributes to the personalization of learning and development through adaptive training platforms that adjust educational content to the individual competencies and career trajectories of employees. Fourth, AI assists in employee engagement and well-being monitoring through sentiment analysis, chatbots for internal communication, and early identification of burnout risks. Fifth, AI enhances strategic workforce planning by supporting data-driven forecasting of workforce needs and identifying competencies required for future organizational development. Despite the benefits, challenges include data protection, transparency of algorithms, and the need for strengthening ethical and regulatory frameworks to prevent discrimination and preserve employee autonomy.\nArtificial intelligence significantly expands the possibilities of personnel management, increasing the accuracy of HR decisions and enabling personalized development strategies. However, effective use of AI requires balanced integration, clear ethical standards, continuous evaluation of algorithms, and the involvement of HR professionals in shaping technology-driven human resource policies.\n\n\nFuture research should focus on developing ethical frameworks for AI in HR, assessing the impact of AI on organizational culture, exploring employee perceptions of algorithmic management, and identifying strategies for increasing trust and transparency in AI-supported HR systems.",

    "abstract": "A new era of data-driven, automated, and intelligent decision-making processes across a broad range of HR tasks is being ushered in by the development of artificial intelligence (AI), which is significantly changing the field of human resource management (HRM). This study examines the revolutionary effects of AI technology on HRM practices by a thorough secondary review of recent scholarly works, industry reports, and case studies. AI-powered hiring and talent acquisition platforms, predictive analytics for assessing employee performance, intelligent workforce planning, automated onboarding, and real-time employee engagement platforms are some of the major areas of disruption that have been highlighted. The study not only highlights these developments but also critically analyzes the risks and difficulties that come with integrating AI, including issues with data privacy, algorithmic and cognitive biases, lack of interpretability, transparency, and the widening digital skill gap among HR professionals. In addition to highlighting the significance of coordinating AI deployment with organizational ethics, legal compliance, and human-centric values, the study delves deeper into the strategic implications of AI in promoting agile, inclusive, and responsive HR ecosystems. As crucial avenues for long-term adoption, emerging themes like explainable AI (XAI), ethical AI governance, and AI literacy in HR are also covered. According to the findings, while AI has the ability to greatly improve HRM's operational efficiency, decision accuracy, and employee experience, long-term success depends on a methodical, morally sound, and strategically integrated strategy.",

    "abstract": "The article discusses the social issues of implementing and using artificial intelligence technologies in human resource management of organizations and enterprises. It addresses experts' expectations and the potential for the adoption of artificial intelligence, as well as the barriers to the implementation of advanced AI functions, which include both technical problems and social ones (the need for a change in corporate culture). The theoretical and methodological foundations of the research are based on a sociological approach that views technologies not as neutral tools but as social artifacts embedded in existing social structures, cultural norms, and organizational practices. The aim of this research is to identify and classify the social problems of implementing and using AI in HR, as well as to assess the current state and prospects of using artificial intelligence technologies in personnel management in companies in the Tyumen region. A fragment of the results of an expert survey of HR specialists and heads of HR departments of companies of various sizes and industry affiliations, conducted in 2024 and 2025 in the Tyumen region, is presented. The analysis revealed that the existing mechanisms of both self-regulation (corporate policies, professional codes) and institutional regulation (legislation) are underdeveloped, fragmentary, and often reactive. They fail to keep pace with the dynamics of technological changes and do not always adequately consider the specifics of the social experiences of various actors involved in digital HR practices. Four main clusters of social problems are identified: algorithmic bias and the reproduction of social inequality; dehumanization of HR processes and erosion of the organization's social capital; violation of privacy and the creation of a \"digital copy\"; transformation of the HR manager profession and the problem of distributed responsibility. Based on the analysis of the use of AI technologies in personnel management of organizations in the Tyumen region and the study of theoretical concepts of self-regulation and institutional regulation, an integrative model of \"Balanced Institutionalization of AI in HR\" is proposed. The principles of the model include: the principle of contextual embeddedness and human sovereignty; the principle of algorithmic transparency and accountability; the principle of preventive assessment of social risks; and the principle of pluralistic regulation.",

    "abstract": "The article develops a conception for the structure of artificial intelligence in digitalized human resource management, based on a historical and evolutionary analysis of the development of intelligent systems, from the earliest ideas of machine thinking to modern generative models. The stages of the evolutionary dynamics of artificial intelligence, which combine periods of growth and decline resulting from discrepancies between the expectations of the scientific community and technological capabilities, are described. It is demonstrated that each new stage of development contributed to the formation of models and directions capable of integrating with other digital tools and expanding the scope of their practical application. The theoretical and methodological foundations for the use of artificial intelligence in the field of digitalized human resource management, as a key business process of a modern enterprise, are developed. The rationale for implementing a hybrid (neuro-symbolic) approach to model training, which combines machine learning with symbolic knowledge and rule-based systems, has been substantiated. This approach allows for greater transparency and control over algorithmic decisions, reduces the risks of bias, and ensures the efficiency of intelligent algorithms. Based on this, practical functional areas of artificial intelligence corresponding to the multifaceted nature of HR processes have been identified. The study also presents arguments for integrating fundamental and applied functional areas into a unified artificial intelligence framework in human resource management, addressing the challenges of digital transformation. The proposed framework features a flexible architecture that facilitates scalable HR process automation, personalized personnel decisions, and enhanced productivity. Practical results from leading global companies confirm the efficiency of applying AI in digitalized human resource management, and the developed conception can serve as a basis for creating scalable digital ecosystems in the HR field.",

This review paper aims to identify trends, challenges, and\noutcomes of AI adoption in HRM functions, considering the sociocultural and economic diversity of Asian countries. It investigates the\nadoption of AI, its application, and its implications across key HRM\nfunctions, including recruitment, training and development,\nperformance appraisal, and employee engagement. This paper adopts a\nsystematic review methodology, synthesising peer-reviewed indexed\njournal articles published from 2020 to 2024. Thematic analysis reveals\nthat AI technologies have enhanced operational efficiency, decisionmaking processes, and personalised employee experiences. However,\ncritical concerns persist regarding data privacy, algorithmic bias, and\nemployee acceptance. Additionally, the uneven pace of AI adoption\nacross industries and countries highlights the influence of regulatory\nframeworks, organisational readiness, and technological infrastructure.\nThis review contributes to the growing body of knowledge by offering\na region-specific perspective on AI integration in HRM, addressing the\nunique complexities of the Asian context. The findings offer practical\ninsights for HR practitioners and policymakers to navigate AI\nimplementation while fostering ethical and inclusive AI adoption. The\npaper also identifies key research gaps, calling for future research to\nexamine the long-term impacts of AI-driven HRM practices and their\nimplications for workforce dynamics in the evolving digital landscape",

    "abstract": "Using Artificial Intelligence (AI) more in Human Resource Management (HRM) can bring many advantages such as making processes faster, more fair, and able to handle larger tasks effectively. However, this change in technology has also brought some new problems, especially biased algorithms. This review looks at how bias appears in AI-based HR systems, especially in hiring, performance reviews, and workforce data analysis. Utilizing inquire about from diverse areas, real-life illustrations, and speculations, this paper looks at how inclination is built into information, how calculations are planned, and how they are utilized. Imperative illustrations, like Amazon\u2019s stopped AI contracting instrument and facial examination utilized by HireVue, appear how these innovations can proceed to make shamefulness based on gender, race, and financial status. The review points out a few reasons for unfairness, such as training data that doesn\u2019t include everyone, unclear algorithms, and no responsibility when putting systems into use. It also looks closely at current laws and ethical rules, pointing out that they are not enough to deal with the complicated issues of bias in artificial intelligence in human resources management.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence is transforming the landscape of Human Resource Management (HRM), altering conventional methods and elevating the recruitment process for companies. The conventional approach to hiring can be incredibly time-intensive, often stretching over several weeks to sift through all applications. This process can be daunting for recruiters, who are tasked with reviewing numerous resumes. AI steps in to streamline this process by rapidly sifting through a large number of applications, identifying the most suitable candidates, and providing concise overviews of their qualifications. This not only saves recruiters time but also allows them to concentrate on improving the candidate experience and attracting top talent. AI operates around the clock, ensuring the recruitment process remains active and effective even when recruiters are not on duty. Moreover, AI can help mitigate bias, when utilized correctly, it can facilitate more equitable hiring decisions by focusing on relevant skills and experiences rather than personal biases. This article explores the multifaceted role of AI in mitigating recruitment bias, AI algorithms use objective data and set criteria to reduce unconscious bias during initial screening. This approach helps ensure that job seekers are evaluated based on qualifications and merit, rather than personal characteristics.",

    "abstract": "The incorporation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology into several industries has significantly impacted the usual workflows and processes in recent years, including the healthcare industry. Human Resource Management (HRM) is essential in healthcare businesses as it is responsible for the recruitment, training, and the retention of skilled staff members who are capable of providing high-quality patient care. This paper investigates different methods in which AI is used in HRM in the healthcare industry on the basis of existing research in the area. It analyzes how AI affects recruitment, talent management, workforce optimization, and employee well-being. This paper also discusses the challenges and future prospects of AI-driven approaches in HRM practices. It explores how these approaches are changing the way healthcare organizations operate and improving patient outcomes. The results provide some valuable contributions to the field of artificial intelligence in the healthcare sector. Initially, the chapter gives a factual foundation for the current presumptions on the implementation and difficulties of artificial intelligence in the healthcare domain. Further, it shows how artificial intelligence provides numerous opportunities to expedite Human Resource operations by offering automated applicant screening, customized learning systems, optimizing the workforce and enhancing employee engagement. Although AI has the capacity to revolutionize HRM practices in the healthcare industry, it also presents some challenges and obstacles. In order to ensure that AI-driven solutions promote fairness, transparency, and equity, it is crucial to address issues such as algorithmic bias, privacy of data and the impact on the human workforce in a deliberate manner. In addition, healthcare firms need to invest funds for implementing rigorous cyber security measures in order to ensure the privacy of patient and employee data from cyber-attacks and potential breaches.",

    "abstract": "As artificial intelligence (AI) systems become more sophisticated, they are increasingly integrated into high-stakes decision-making processes, such as hiring, fraud detection, loan approvals, and medical diagnoses. However, this growing reliance on AI raises concerns about the potential for these systems to perpetuate and amplify societal biases. Researchers have developed two main approaches to bias mitigation in AI to address this issue: human-in-the-loop (HITL) systems and AI fairness toolkits. HITL systems involve human reviewers actively participating in the AI decision-making process, while AI fairness toolkits are software tools that can identify and mitigate bias. HITL systems are particularly effective in addressing biases tied to specific domains, while AI fairness toolkits can be useful in identifying and addressing bias proactively. This paper examines different combinations of HITL systems and AI fairness toolkits, conducts an experiment to evaluate biases in hiring decisions using each, and provides recommendations for organizations considering implementing one or both approaches.",

Ancient civilizations contained tales of intelligent robots, such as Greek and Chinese cultures. AI as a modern phenomenon which took shape in the mid-20th century with the advent of digital computers. The first breakthrough, published in 1950, was Alan Turing's paper, \u2018Computing Machinery and Intelligence. AI can make provide detailed solution to users and experts. They can act independently, replacing the need for human intelligence or intervention (a classic example being a self-driving car). Many sectors like finance, healthcare, to human resource management (HRM), rely on AI technologies. AI's integration in HRM has brought about great change in conventional HR practices used to measure efficiency, accuracy, strategic decision-making, etc. AI technologies help to provide solution to automation of repetitive tasks, analysis of sprawling volumes of data and insights facilitating decision-making. Through this research paper we try to understand the AI's effects on HR processes, in terms of recruitment, onboarding, performance appraisal, training and development, employee engagement, workforce planning; understanding the benefits and cons of implementing AI in HRM; ethical considerations and potential biases in AI algorithms relevant to HR practices; analysis of emergent AI trends with respect to HRM. Trends in AI in HR tend towards a most promising future, presenting several innovations. Accordingly, HR professionals will be expected to acquire competency with regards to new roles and responsibilities to avail AI in enhancing strategic planning, ethical oversight, and data-driven decision-making.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) in organizational management has significantly enhanced operational efficiency. However, it has introduced ethical challenges in human resource management. Between January to March 2024, this study conducted 21 semi-structured interviews with middle-level managers from high-tech companies in Beijing. Through word frequency analysis, the study found that key topics among the managers were \u201ccompany,\u201d \u201cdata,\u201d \u201csystem,\u201d and \u201cproblem,\u201d with \u201cAI\u201d frequently recurring in the discussions. Sentiment analysis revealed generally favorable attitudes toward AI in human resource management (AI-HRM), along with nuanced emotional expressions such as inquiry, introspection, recommendation, challenge, adaptation, resistance, and indifference. The sentiment distribution of keywords aligned with topic trends. Thematic analysis identified key ethical concerns in AI-HRM, including issues related to data collection and utilization, human versus machine decision-making, quantitative versus qualitative assessment methodologies, the balance between fairness and efficiency, the need for trustworthy, explainable, and transparent AI, and the oversight of AI-HRM. This study contributes to the ethical investigation of AI-HRM from the perspective of middle-level managers, highlighting themes that are critical for understanding the theory, application, and future development of AI-HRM.",

Traditional performance\nappraisal methods remain infrequent, biased, and disengaging, while AI-based systems risk dehumanization and\nalgorithmic bias if not ethically guided. This paper seeks to bridge this divide by proposing a comprehensive model that\nharmonizes data-driven analytics with empathetic, human-led management practices.\nObjective: The study aims to develop and present the Integrated Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HCAI)\nPerformance & Development Model, a conceptual framework designed to operationalize the principles of HCAI\nin performance evaluation and learning systems. The model seeks to transform performance management from a\ncompliance-oriented activity into a continuous, developmental, and ethically grounded process.\nMethodology: Employing a conceptual research design, this paper utilizes a theory-building approach based on the\nsystematic synthesis and thematic analysis of existing scholarship in AI analytics, continuous performance feedback,\nmotivational theory, and managerial coaching. The resulting model was constructed through iterative conceptual\nintegration, informed by both empirical studies and theoretical frameworks, and elaborated using descriptive narrative\nsupported by a visual schematic.\nFindings:The research introduces the Integrated HCAI Performance & Development Model, comprising four\ninterdependent components:\n(1) the AI-Powered Analytics Engine, which aggregates multidimensional performance data to identify trends, skill\ngaps, and development opportunities;\n(2) the Human-Centered Interpretation Layer, where managers apply empathetic judgment to contextualize AI-generated\ninsights;\n(3) the Continuous Feedback & Development Loop, which facilitates ongoing dialogue and co-created learning plans;\nand\n(4) the Strategic HR Policy Foundation, ensuring ethical integrity, transparency, and fairness. Collectively, these\ncomponents align organizational policies with human-centered, technology-enhanced practices. Conclusion: The model provides an actionable framework for integrating intelligent analytics and human empathy to\nenhance performance management and employee development. It underscores the pivotal role of strategic HR leadership\nin ethically governing AI systems and cultivating a culture of psychological safety and learning. Future research should\nfocus on empirical validation through longitudinal and quantitative studies to assess the model\u2019s impact on performance\noutcomes, motivation, and organizational adaptability.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) represents a transformative technology with the potential to profoundly influence organizational behavior (OB). It can enhance organizational performance and efficiency through mechanisms such as automation, resource optimization, and advanced data analysis. Nevertheless, the integration of AI within organizations presents various social and ethical dilemmas that could adversely impact fairness, privacy, and employee satisfaction. This research aims to develop a comprehensive framework that elucidates the role of AI in enhancing OB while also identifying the associated challenges and opportunities through a meta\u2010synthesis approach. A systematic review of the literature was conducted, focusing on studies that explore the intersection of AI and OB, employing a qualitative meta\u2010synthesis methodology. The data were sourced from scholarly articles published in esteemed scientific databases from 1995 to 2024. Ultimately, 18 articles specifically relevant to this subject were selected, and the data underwent analysis through open coding. This process yielded 231 distinct codes, which were subsequently organized and integrated based on their conceptual similarities into various dimensions and components. The findings showed that the impact of AI on OB includes five main dimensions: (1) automation, (2) innovation and organizational learning, (3) intelligent decision\u2010making, (4) organizational culture and human interactions, and (5) ethics and leadership. These dimensions include components such as data analysis, improved decision\u2010making, personalization, trust and information security, and adaptation to new technologies. Finally, a research model was presented focusing on these dimensions. In addition to the benefits related to productivity and improved decision\u2010making, the implementation of AI in organizations requires ethical and cultural considerations to maintain satisfaction and human interactions. Paying attention to algorithmic fairness and transparency in decision\u2010making can strengthen employee trust and facilitate the adoption of this technology. Therefore, organizations should manage the implementation of AI in a way that serves the development of OB and improved performance through training, developing ethical frameworks, and providing appropriate support.",

While proponents champion AI as a means to enhance efficiency, reduce bias, and align HR practices with strategic business goals, this paper argues that such optimism is misplaced. Drawing on a critical review of AI's application across four core HRM functions\u2014recruitment, compensation, scheduling, and performance management\u2014this paper identifies significant risks and limitations arising from the fundamental structure of AI systems. Central to the analysis is a three-parameter framework for assessing AI tools: their objective, the data they rely upon, and how they are programmed. The paper shows that across HR functions, AI systems frequently operationalize reductive or poorly aligned objectives, rely on low-quality or biased data, and are programmed in non-transparent ways that undermine their usefulness. These structural shortcomings not only undermine the effectiveness of AI systems but also introduce legal, ethical, and practical risks for firms and their workers.",

Still, this progress isn't without substantial ethical and legal enterprises. This narrative review synthesizes findings from six crucial studies including abstract analyses, empirical checks, and legal reviews to critically examine the pressing counteraccusations of AI deployment in HRM across global and indigenous surrounds.\u00a0\u00a0 The review reveals a strong agreement around several core challenges warrant of translucency and explain ability in AI- driven opinions, the perpetuation of algorithmic bias, violations of data sequestration rights, and unclear legal responsibility in cases of demarcation or detriment. Studies similar as Harper & Millard (2023) and Du (2024) highlight crunches in current employment laws, particularly in regulating automated decision- timber, while Cheong (2024) underscores the ethical pitfalls posed by opaque AI systems and calls for integrated governance fabrics. Empirical substantiation from Khan et al. (2023) and Nawaz (2023) further illustrates how AI relinquishment in reclamation can affect in perceived unfairness, especially when stakeholders are barred from the design process or when systems are trained on prejudiced data. In developing surrounds like Nigeria and Pakistan, structural constraints including limited structure, low AI knowledge, and weak nonsupervisory oversight \u2014 emulsion these pitfalls, as reported by Elenwo (2025) and Khan et al.

    "abstract": "The birth of artificial intelligence was between 1950-1956 but AI in HRM practices was used first in the 2000s. This rapid advancement of AI has significantly transformed Human Resource Management Practices. AI-based systems currently help HR automate a large segment of repetitive tasks in processes such as talent screening, hiring, engaging, re-engaging, employee relations, onboarding, etc, which used to be a long and hectic task before the introduction of automated tools. Nevertheless, these automated practices raise ethical concerns about bias, transparency, and how AI may undermine human judgment. The focus of this paper is to discuss and analyze the present scenario of AI in the field of HR. It has suggested that AI has the potential to optimize HRM practices leading to higher efficiency and cost-cutting, while also exposing several other challenges and risks such as data privacy and security, job disarticulation, and diminished autonomy for employees. By doing a real-world experiment on a normal and ATS-friendly resume and reviewing case studies such as an ATS rejecting a company\u2019s own manager, this research investigates the balance between AI efficiency and human judgment.",

By examining AI tools used in pre-screening, candidate engagement, and evaluation through the diverse frameworks of Human Capital Theory, Organizational Justice Theory, the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), and Critical Theory, this study highlights underlying concerns such as algorithmic bias, the risk of impersonal or dehumanized candidate experiences, and the diminishing protection of applicant privacy. It contributes a novel and comprehensive framework meticulously designed for evaluating AI recruitment strategies, integrating disparate theoretical perspectives to furnish practical guidance for both Human Resource (HR) professionals and AI vendors.

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) comes in many forms and has entered the overall system of organisations including in human resource (HR), where AI started to replace some of the human functions. Nonetheless, despite increased academic interest, research on AI-based HR tools is limited and fragmented. This article discusses the challenges and opportunities brought together during AI intervention in innovating HR functions. This study systematically reviews the existing literature, highlighting key areas where AI is being integrated, such as recruitment, employee engagement, training and development, and performance assessment. With the integration of AI, it successfully helps the industry to work in more effective and efficient ways through enhancing employee learning experiences, mitigating human biases, reducing manpower and training cost, and increasing employee engagement and retention. On the other hand, there are also studies that have raised the concern of the challenges during the AI integration, such as high implementation cost of technology tools, uncertainty and employee resistance, lack of human touch and legal and ethical concerns. This paper argues that successful integration of AI in HR functions requires a holistic approach. Collaboration between HR professionals and AI experts is crucial to address technical and ethical challenges. To leverage AI, organisations must embrace change management strategies to facilitate a smooth transition and foster a culture of continuous improvement. This study sheds light on how AI is transforming HR functions and establishes the groundwork for future research such as competency development, workplace learning, and organisation development, enabling practitioners and scholars to navigate the intricate terrain of AI integration in HR successfully.",

    "abstract": "As the technological expansion of Artificial Intelligence (AI) penetrates various industries, Human Resource Management has attempted to keep pace with the new capabilities and challenges these technologies have brought. When adopting AI, transparency within HRM decisions is an increasing demand to establish ethical, unbiased, and fair practices within a firm. To this end, explainable AI (XAI) methods have become vital in achieving transparency within HRM decision-making. Thus, there has been a growing interest in exploring successful XAI techniques, as evidenced by the systematic literature review (SLR) performed in this paper. Our SLR starts by revealing where AI exists within HRM. Following this, we review the literature on XAI and accuracy, XAI design, accountability, and data processing initiatives within HRM. The integrated framework we propose provides an avenue to bridge the gap between transparent HRM practices and Artificial Intelligence, providing the industrial and academic community with better insight into where XAI could exist within HRM processes.",

The key goals are to determine how artificial intelligence improves decision-making efficiency, investigate the fairness issues involved in AI-driven human resource practices, and make policy suggestions for engaging in ethical HR practices. The approach utilized is known as secondary data analysis. It is used to synthesize insights and patterns by pulling upon previously published literature and empirical investigations; even though artificial intelligence technologies present an opportunity to optimize human resource operations and improve organizational performance, significant findings demonstrate that these technologies also create ethical problems connected to algorithmic biases and an absence of transparency. Regulatory oversight, ethical standards, data governance, diversity and inclusion programs, and constant monitoring and assessment are some of the policy implications that should be considered to guarantee responsible deployment of artificial intelligence in human resource contexts. When it comes to human resource decision-making, companies can embrace the revolutionary potential of artificial intelligence (AI) while maintaining ethical standards if they prioritize justice, openness, and accountability.",

    "abstract": "Calls for \u201cethical Artificial Intelligence\u201d are legion, with a recent proliferation of government and industry guidelines attempting to establish ethical rules and boundaries for this new technology. With few exceptions, they interpret Artificial Intelligence (AI) ethics narrowly in a liberal political framework of privacy concerns, transparency, governance and non-discrimination. One of the main hurdles to establishing \u201cethical AI\u201d remains how to operationalize high-level principles such that they translate to technology design, development and use in the labor process. This is because organizations can end up interpreting ethics in an ad-hoc way with no oversight, treating ethics as simply another technological problem with technological solutions, and regulations have been largely detached from the issues AI presents for workers. There is a distinct lack of supra-national standards for fair, decent, or just AI in contexts where people depend on and work in tandem with it. Topics such as discrimination and bias in job allocation, surveillance and control in the labor process, and quantification of work have received significant attention, yet questions around AI and job quality and working conditions have not. This has left workers exposed to potential risks and harms of AI. In this paper, we provide a critique of relevant academic literature and policies related to AI ethics. We then identify a set of principles that could facilitate fairer working conditions with AI. As part of a broader research initiative with the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence, we propose a set of accountability mechanisms to ensure AI systems foster fairer working conditions. Such processes are aimed at reshaping the social impact of technology from the point of inception to set a research agenda for the future. As such, the key contribution of the paper is how to bridge from abstract ethical principles to operationalizable processes in the vast field of AI and new technology at work.",

    "abstract": "The integration of new technologies in professional contexts has emerged as a critical determinant of organizational efficiency and competitiveness. In this regard, the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in recruitment processes facilitates faster and more accurate decision-making by processing large volumes of data, minimizing human bias, and offering personalized recommendations to enhance talent development and candidate selection. The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) provides a valuable framework for understanding recruiters\u2019 perceptions of innovative technologies, such as AI tools and GenAI. Drawing on the TAM, a model was developed to explain the intention to use AI tools, proposing that perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness influence attitudes toward AI, which subsequently affect the intention to use AI tools in recruitment and selection processes. Two studies were conducted in Portugal to address this research objective. The first was a qualitative exploratory study involving 100 interviews with recruiters who regularly utilize AI tools in their professional activities. The second study employed a quantitative confirmatory approach, utilizing an online questionnaire completed by 355 recruiters. The qualitative findings underscored the transformative role of AI in recruitment, emphasizing its potential to enhance efficiency and optimize resource management. However, recruiters also highlighted concerns regarding the potential loss of personal interaction and the need to adapt roles within this domain. The results also supported the indirect effect of perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness on the use of AI tools in recruitment and selection processes via positive attitudes toward the use of these tools. This suggests that AI is best positioned as a complementary tool rather than a replacement for human decision-making. The insights gathered from recruiters\u2019 perspectives provide actionable recommendations for organizations seeking to leverage AI in recruitment processes. Specifically, the findings show the importance of ethical considerations and maintaining human involvement to ensure a balanced and effective integration of AI tools.",

While existing studies have extensively explored the potential of AI in improving efficiency and objectivity, they often overlook the nuanced employee experiences and organizational dynamics that influence its successful implementation. This research bridges this gap by examining the perceptions and experiences of PT Pos Indonesia employees regarding the use of an AI-based performance evaluation system. Using a qualitative approach with a phenomenological design, data was collected through in-depth interviews with employees who have used the system for at least six months. The findings reveal that AI contributes significantly to enhancing efficiency and reducing subjectivity in evaluations. However, challenges such as algorithm bias, the relevance of performance metrics, and system transparency remain prevalent. Importantly, this study identifies critical factors influencing acceptance, including employee understanding, trust, and perceptions of fairness in the evaluation process. Unlike previous research, this study emphasizes the interplay between technological and human factors, highlighting the irreplaceable role of human interaction in providing qualitative context. This research extends the existing literature by offering a deeper understanding of employee-centered factors and organizational practices that facilitate the integration of AI in performance evaluation. Practically, it provides actionable insights for organizations aiming to implement AI-based systems effectively, ethically, and equitably.",

    "abstract": "The article explores the ethical aspects of using artificial intelligence (AI) in international HR management, with a particular focus on the risks of discrimination that may arise from the use of historical data. The authors analyze the impact of AI algorithms on key HR processes, including hiring, promotion, and performance evaluation. It is found that automated systems can unconsciously reproduce biases inherent in the original data sets, which can lead to unequal treatment of candidates and employees. \nSpecial attention is paid to the problems of algorithm transparency, personal data protection, and injustice in automated HR systems. An important aspect is the issue of trust in algorithmic solutions, their explainability, and compliance with international standards of ethics and regulation. The lack of clarity and complexity of algorithms can lead to situations where HR professionals cannot explain the reasons for making a decision, which, in turn, reduces the trust in the use of AI in HR management. \nThe article suggests methods to minimize the risks of bias, including careful selection and adjustment of initial data, auditing algorithms for discriminatory factors, ensuring transparency of decision-making processes, and applying a hybrid approach that combines automated systems with human control. In addition, the authors emphasize the importance of adhering to ethical standards and international norms when developing and implementing AI in HR processes. \nAn important aspect of the study is the need to train HR professionals in the principles of working with AI, understanding its capabilities and limitations, as well as methods for identifying and correcting potentially unfair algorithmic decisions. Training and professional development of HR managers in the field of ethical use of AI will help to form a more responsible approach to its application. \nThe author also notes that in order to ensure the effective and fair use of AI in HR, it is necessary to continue developing regulatory frameworks and corporate policies. This will not only minimize the potential risks of discrimination but will also help to increase the overall trust in automated HR solutions. The development of regulatory documents, standardization of approaches to auditing algorithms, and improvement of mechanisms for assessing their ethics are key elements for further integration of AI in HR at the international level.",

    "abstract": "The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has led to the recognition of tools like ChatGPT and its potential to transform human resource (HR) management processes, particularly in decision-making. This review study aims to assess the effectiveness and benefits of ChatGPT in enhancing HR functions, particularly decision-making, and to identify any challenges and ethical considerations involved. Additionally, the study seeks to establish a hybrid framework that combines AI-driven decision-making with human oversight. A systematic literature review was conducted using PRISMA guidelines, selecting 50 articles from Scopus and Google Scholar databases. The literature review includes a synthesis analysis to assess publication trends and a keyword analysis to identify key themes such as ChatGPT\u2019s impact on decision-making in HR management. The study reveals that ChatGPT can streamline HR processes, improve communication, and support personalized learning and decision-making, eventually contributing to enhanced performance and engagement. However, the technology requires human input for moral judgment and empathy, presenting challenges like resistance to adoption, algorithmic bias, and data privacy concerns. This study uniquely contributes to the literature by providing a systematic analysis of ChatGPT\u2019s role in HR decision-making and proposing a hybrid framework that addresses AI\u2019s limitations through ethical guidelines and human oversight. The findings emphasize the need for empirical research in larger, diverse settings and future enhancements to ChatGPT\u2019s contextual understanding of HR.",

    "abstract": "The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming Human Resource Management (HRM), yet its adoption within the unique context of higher education institutions remains underexplored, particularly in developing nations. This study addresses this gap by investigating the application and implications of AI in core HRM functions, specifically recruitment, performance evaluation, and workforce planning, at a public university in Indonesia. Adopting an exploratory qualitative case study methodology, this study sourced data from twelve purposively selected stakeholders, including HR managers, academic leaders, and IT personnel, through semi-structured interviews, document analysis, and non-participant observation. The collected data were systematically analyzed using thematic analysis, revealing a dual impact of AI adoption. While AI integration significantly enhances operational efficiency by automating recruitment screening and supporting data-driven workforce planning, it also introduces critical challenges, including the risk of algorithmic bias, a lack of transparency, and the potential erosion of human judgment in culturally sensitive evaluations. The study concludes that successful AI implementation in academic HRM is contingent upon institutional readiness, a supportive organizational culture, and a robust technological infrastructure. By applying the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE), Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), and Diffusion of Innovation (DoI) frameworks, this research contributes a nuanced understanding of the factors shaping AI adoption in higher education, underscoring the necessity of a balanced approach that leverages AI's benefits while preserving essential human oversight in university administration.",

It examines how these emerging technologies are redefining HRM practices, with a particular focus on recruitment, training and human capital management. A methodology was used that integrates a quantitative analysis, derived from data collected through a structured survey on a Likert scale, and a systematic review of the literature. This two-pronged approach allowed us to assess perceptions about the implementation of AI in HRM and to identify emerging trends and patterns in recent studies. The results show that AI and automation contribute to greater efficiency in recruitment and selection processes, promoting greater equality in the identification and progression of talent. There was also a positive impact on skills development and vocational training, underlining the importance of adaptive strategies for the continuous development of employees. We face ethical and privacy challenges regarding the use of AI in HR. It highlights the need for robust practices for the protection of employee data and the prevention of bias and discrimination in algorithms. The importance of human intervention in automated decisions is highlighted, ensuring the maintenance of fairness and ethics, as well as the need for professional requalification in the face of technological changes. The study concludes that despite the challenges, AI and automation offer unprecedented opportunities for innovation in HRM. Organizations that integrate these technologies with the human elements of work are better prepared for a dynamic and technologically advanced future.",

In this regard, the European Parliament and the European Council launched a legislative initiative to define harmonized rules within the Community on the use of artificial intelligence. Concepts such as \"algorithmic discrimination\" were introduced quite purposefully at the regulation level, given the risk of possible abuses associated with the use of AI. This report aims to ascertain the views of employers and employees on the use of artificial intelligence in Human Resource Management. The report presents and analyses data from an empirical study conducted among managers and employees in leading ICT enterprises in Bulgaria. According to our responders, one of the biggest advantages of using AI in Human Resources Management is related to the elimination of subjectivity in performance evaluation and the possibility of fair play in the procedures of internal selection of employees. At the same time, employees with more experience (over 10 years) are more sceptical of the idea of their work performance being evaluated solely by AI, while younger workers show more trust in AI solutions. However, both managers and workers recognize that it is best for the final decision in determining career development to be made by a person, but justified by the analyses made by AI. The report draws conclusions and recommendations that can serve both researchers and business managers. Certainly, AI is yet to undergo a very large development and application, including in the Human Resource Management, but at the same time it should not be at the expense of affected rights.",

    "abstract": "In the face of ground-breaking advancements such as automation, artificial intelligence, and the gig economy, the realm of human resource management (HRM) is undergoing a profound transformation. As the nature of work evolves, HRM practices must adapt to ensure both organizational performance and employee well-being. A primary focus of the study is the increasing emphasis on workforce flexibility. The rise of remote work, flexible schedules, and contingent labour has necessitated a shift in HRM practices. This research explores how organizations can effectively manage a diverse workforce while maintaining productivity and employee satisfaction. Additionally, the study examines the impact of job changes, including automation-driven task shifts and the emergence of new roles. It investigates how HR professionals can assist employees in adapting to these changes and acquiring the necessary skills for the future of work. Ethical considerations are also a central theme of this research. With the rise of AI and automation, questions surrounding data privacy, algorithmic bias, and ethical decision-making in the workplace have become increasingly pressing. The study explores the ethical implications of these technologies and provides guidance for HR professionals on developing ethical policies and practices. This research study underscores the critical role of HRM in fostering a productive and supportive work environment. It highlights the need for HR professionals to be strategic partners with business leaders, aligning HR practices with overall organizational goals. By understanding the challenges and opportunities presented by these revolutionary developments, HR professionals can equip their organizations to navigate the complexities of the contemporary workplace and achieve long-term success. This research offers a valuable resource for HR professionals, business executives, and policymakers seeking to understand the changing landscape of HRM and develop effective strategies for managing their workforce in the face of technological advancements and evolving workforce dynamics. \nReferences \nAdams-Prassl, J.

    "abstract": "The paper examines the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the main processes of human resource management. It is noted that in modern conditions, AI is considered an advanced tool that can optimize management processes in various sectors of the economy. The author discusses the new opportunities that AI opens up in human resource management, increasing the efficiency of actions at all levels and complementing human abilities. The main part of the paper is devoted to the advantages and potential opportunities of using AI at different stages of the employee's life cycle in a company. In particular, the author emphasizes the optimization of recruitment through analytical processing of large amounts of information rather than subjective judgment. The paper highlights such areas as operational efficiency, recruitment, onboarding, talent management, strategic planning, career development, and management changes where AI can make a significant contribution. The paper also highlights the issues related to the potential dangers of introducing AI technologies. The level of readiness and the degree of involvement of managers in the latest technologies in human resource management is indicated. The paper raises the issue of efficiency and solving various problems. In addition, examples of real software products are provided. The conclusions emphasize the general perspective of using AI in HR processes and identify areas for further research. In particular, there is a call for the development of mechanisms to protect employees from possible misuse of AI and the development of effective strategies for the implementation of technologies that would take into account ethical aspects. The final part of the paper sets the task for the business community and legislative bodies to actively work on standards for the use of AI in HR to create fair and effective HR management.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence is increasingly employed to predict employee attrition, enabling organisations to improve talent retention and workforce planning. However, without explicit consideration of fairness, these models risk embedding and amplifying societal biases. This study examines bias in AI-based attrition prediction using a Random Forest classifier applied to the IBM HR Analytics employee attrition dataset. Although the model demonstrates high predictive performance (92.3 percent) and an area under the curve of 0.97, subgroup analysis reveals disparities in prediction performance across gender. Fairness assessments based on equal accuracy, demographic parity, and equality of opportunity show that predictions for female employees achieve higher precision and recall than those for male employees, suggesting differential predictive performance across gender groups. The findings highlight organisational risks associated with such disparities, including the risk of unjust decision-making, reduced employee trust, and hindered diversity and inclusion efforts. To mitigate these challenges, the study recommends fairness-aware strategies such as balanced sampling, established fairness metrics, post-processing approaches (e.g., equalised odds), and continuous model auditing. This research underscores the ethical importance of aligning AI systems in human resource management with principles of equity, transparency, and accountability.",

    "abstract": "This study explores the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies to advance sustainable recruitment, focusing on both environmental and social sustainability. AI-driven systems, including machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP), offer significant improvements by automating tasks such as resume screening, candidate profiling, and interview scheduling. These technologies reduce resource consumption, eliminate the need for physical interviews and paperwork, and lower the carbon footprint of recruitment processes. Adopting a theoretical and conceptual analysis methodology, this research draws on a comprehensive review of AI applications in recruitment and sustainability frameworks. No primary data was collected; instead, the study utilizes secondary data from academic literature, industry reports, and expert insights. A conceptual framework is developed to illustrate how AI can be systematically integrated into recruitment processes to enhance sustainability, highlighting stages such as data collection, decision-making, and feedback loops to improve AI algorithms over time. The findings suggest that AI can contribute significantly to resource efficiency by digitizing recruitment processes and reducing environmental impacts like travel-related emissions. Moreover, AI enhances social sustainability by promoting diversity and inclusion in hiring, as automated systems reduce biases in candidate selection. Key strategies include adopting energy-efficient AI technologies, ensuring ethical use through algorithm audits, and leveraging feedback mechanisms to optimize AI performance. Policymakers are encouraged to develop regulations promoting transparency and accountability in AI use. Future research should explore AI\u2019s broader role in human resource management, ensuring its sustainability potential is fully realized.",

However, to avoid employees\u2019 antipathy toward AI, it is important to understand what aspects of AI employees like and/or dislike. In this paper, we aim to identify how employees perceive current human resource (HR) teams and future algorithmic management. Specifically, we explored what factors negatively influence employees\u2019 perceptions of AI making work performance evaluations. Through in-depth interviews with 21 workers, we found that 1) employees feel six types of burdens (i.e., emotional, mental, bias, manipulation, privacy, and social) toward AI's introduction to human resource management (HRM), and that 2) these burdens could be mitigated by incorporating transparency, interpretability, and human intervention to algorithmic decision-making. Based on our findings, we present design efforts to alleviate employees\u2019 burdens. To leverage AI for HRM in fair and trustworthy ways, we call for the HCI community to design human-AI collaboration systems with various HR stakeholders.",

    "abstract": "The recruitment process significantly impacts an organization's performance, productivity, and culture. Traditionally, human resource experts and industrial-organizational psychologists have developed systematic hiring methods, including job advertising, candidate skill assessments, and structured interviews to ensure candidate-organization fit. Recently, recruitment practices have shifted dramatically toward artificial intelligence (AI)-based methods, driven by the need to efficiently manage large applicant pools. However, reliance on AI raises concerns about the amplification and propagation of human biases embedded within hiring algorithms, as empirically demonstrated by biases in candidate ranking systems and automated interview assessments. Consequently, algorithmic fairness has emerged as a critical consideration in AI-driven recruitment, aimed at rigorously addressing and mitigating these biases. This paper systematically reviews biases identified in AI-driven recruitment systems, categorizes fairness metrics and bias mitigation techniques, and highlights auditing approaches used in practice. We emphasize critical gaps and current limitations, proposing future directions to guide researchers and practitioners toward more equitable AI recruitment practices, promoting fair candidate treatment and enhancing organizational outcomes.",

    "abstract": "The study looks into how artificial intelligence (AI) affects hiring procedures, focusing on the fairness of the algorithms that drive these tools. AI has improved the efficiency of the hiring process, yet its use results in institutionalised discrimination. The AI systems used for recruitment, which base evaluations on past performance data, have the potential to discriminate against minority candidates as well as women through unintentional actions. The ability of AI systems to decrease human biases during recruitment encounters major challenges, as Amazon's discriminatory resume screening demonstrates the issues in systemic bias maintenance. This paper discusses the origins of algorithmic bias, including biased training records, defining labels, and choosing features, and suggests debiasing methods. Methods such as reweighting, adversarial debiasing, and fairness-aware algorithms are assessed for suitability in developing unbiased AI hiring systems. A quantitative approach is used in the research, web scraping data from extensive secondary sources to assess these biases and their mitigation measures. A Fair Machine Learning (FML) theoretical framework is utilised, which introduces fairness constraints into machine learning models so that hiring models do not perpetuate present discrimination. The ethical, legal, and organisational ramifications of using AI for recruitment are further examined under GDPR and Equal Employment Opportunity law provisions. By investigating HR practitioners' experiences and AI-based recruitment data, the study aims to develop guidelines for designing open, accountable, and equitable AI-based hiring processes. The findings emphasise the value of human oversight and the necessity of regular audits to guarantee equity in AI hiring software and, consequently, encourage diversity and equal opportunity during employment.",

    "abstract": "The process of conducting interviews plays a pivotal role in human resource management, as it directly influences the selection of candidates and ultimately shapes the composition of an organization's workforce. However, traditional interview methods are often subjective and prone to biases, leading to suboptimal decision-making. In recent years, the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies has provided new opportunities to revolutionize interview analysis and improve decision-making in the hiring process.This research paper explores the application of AI-enabled interview analysis in human resource management, aiming to unveil insights and enhance decision-making. The study focuses on three main areas: interview data collection, analysis, and decision-making support. AI technologies, including natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms, are leveraged to analyze interview transcripts, audio recordings, and other relevant data sources.By analyzing interview data using AI, this research uncovers hidden patterns, linguistic cues, and behavioural indicators that may be missed by human interviewers. These insights provide a deeper understanding of candidate suitability, skills, and competencies, enabling HR professionals to make more informed and objective decisions. Moreover, AI algorithms can be trained to identify biases and mitigate their impact, leading to fairer and more inclusive hiring practices. The research also investigates the potential challenges and ethical considerations associated with AI- enabled interview analysis. Concerns related to privacy, data security, algorithmic biases, and the role of human judgment in decision-making are examined, highlighting the need for responsible implementation and ongoing monitoring.To validate the effectiveness of AI-enabled interview analysis, a mixed-methods approach is employed, combining quantitative data analysis and qualitative feedback from HR professionals. The study presents empirical evidence demonstrating the benefits of AI technologies in improving decision-making accuracy, efficiency, and fairness. Key Index Terms: Digital AI-enabled interview analysis, Hiring process, Decision-making, Interview data analysis, Natural language processing (NLP), Machine learning algorithms, Candidate selection, Workforce composition, Objective decision-making, Hidden patterns, Linguistic cues.",

In this experimental survey study with open-ended qualitative questions, we examine decision making in six HRM functions and manipulate the decision maker (AI or human) and decision valence (positive or negative) to determine their impact on individuals\u2019 experiences of interactional justice, trust, dehumanization, and perceptions of decision-maker role appropriateness. In terms of decision makers, the use of human decision makers over AIs generally resulted in better perceptions of respectful treatment. In terms of decision valence, people experiencing positive over negative decisions generally resulted in better perceptions of respectful treatment. In instances where these cases conflict, on some indicators people preferred positive AI decisions over negative human decisions. Qualitative responses show how people identify justice concerns with both AI and human decision making. We outline implications for theory, practice, and future research.",

Through a PRISMA-based systematic literature review, the paper examines many machine learning algorithms including XGBoost, SVM, random forest, and linear regression in decision-making related to employee-attrition prediction and talent management. The findings suggest that these technologies can automate HR processes, reduce bias, and personalize employee experiences. However, the implementation of AI in HRM also presents challenges, including data privacy concerns, algorithmic bias, and organizational resistance. To address these obstacles, the study highlights the importance of adopting ethical AI frameworks, ensuring transparency in decision-making, and developing effective integration strategies. Future research should focus on improving explainability, minimizing algorithmic bias, and promoting fairness in AI-driven HR practices.",

We investigate the implementation and outcomes of AI-driven recruitment tools at five major corporations: Unilever, IBM, Hilton Hotels, Siemens, and Google. The research focuses on how AI technologies, including machine learning, natural language processing, and predictive analytics, are being utilized to streamline hiring processes, reduce costs, and improve candidate selection. Through analysis of these case studies, we find that AI significantly reduces time-to-hire, with some companies reporting up to 85% reduction in recruitment time. Cost savings are substantial, with decreases in recruitment expenses of up to 30%. Moreover, AI implementation has led to improved hiring accuracy and retention rates, with one company noting a 16% improvement in retention. The study also reveals enhanced diversity in hiring outcomes and improved candidate experiences. However, challenges persist, including concerns about data privacy and potential algorithmic bias. The research concludes that while AI offers significant benefits in recruitment, a balance between technological efficiency and human judgment remains crucial for fair and effective hiring practices. These findings provide valuable insights for HR professionals, business leaders, and job seekers navigating the evolving landscape of AI-driven recruitment.",

Some examples such as Amazon\u2019s discriminating recruiting algorithm showed that algorithms are not free of unethical decision making. Although there already exists a variety of ethics principles for AI-based systems, those are usually hardly being applicable to specific use cases such as using AI-based algorithms in recruiting processes. To address this issue and to provide guidance for researchers and practitioners, we conducted a systematic literature review (keyword and backwards search) on existing ethics guidelines and principles for AI and extracted aspects that seemed applicable to guide recruiting processed. Based on 28 relevant papers we derived actionable guidelines for using AI-based algorithms in recruiting processes. We categorized our guidelines into the aspects of fairness, avoidance of discrimination and avoidance of bias.",

As these systems become increasingly integrated into organizational practices and processes, understanding their impact on workers' experiences and job designs is critical. However, the ongoing discourse surrounding AI use in the workplace remains divided. Proponents of the technology extol its benefits for enhancing efficiency and productivity, while others voice concerns about the potential harm to human workers. To provide greater clarity on this pressing issue, this article presents a systematic review of empirical research that sheds light on the implications of AI use at work. Organized under five inductively generated themes within a multilevel framework, we uncover individual, group, and organizational factors that shape the interplay between humans and AI. Specifically, the themes are: (1) human\u2013AI collaboration; (2) perceptions of algorithmic and human capabilities; (3) worker attitudes towards AI; (4) AI as a control mechanism in algorithmic management of platform\u2010based work; and (5) labor market implications of AI use. Our review offers insights into these themes and identifies five pathways for future research. Finally, we provide practical recommendations for organizational leaders seeking to implement AI technologies while prioritizing their employees' well\u2010being.",

Meaningful work refers to the perception that one\u2019s work has worth, significance, or a higher purpose. The development and organisational deployment of AI is accelerating, but the ways in which this will support or diminish opportunities for meaningful work and the ethical implications of these changes remain under-explored. This conceptual paper is positioned at the intersection of the meaningful work and ethical AI literatures and offers a detailed assessment of the ways in which the deployment of AI can enhance or diminish employees\u2019 experiences of meaningful work. We first outline the nature of meaningful work and draw on philosophical and business ethics accounts to establish its ethical importance. We then explore the impacts of three paths of AI deployment (replacing some tasks, \u2018tending the machine\u2019, and amplifying human skills) across five dimensions constituting a holistic account of meaningful work, and finally assess the ethical implications. In doing so we help to contextualise the meaningful work literature for the era of AI, extend the ethical AI literature into the workplace, and conclude with a range of practical implications and future research directions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Current understanding of what constitutes work in the growing gig economy is heavily conflated, ranging from conceptualisations of independent contracting to other forms of contingent labour. This article calls for a move away from problematic aggregations by proposing a classification of gig work into three variants, all based strongly upon key technological features: app\u2010work, crowdwork, and capital platform work. Focusing specifically on the app\u2010work variant, this article's more delineated focus on the textured dimensions of this work proposes new lines of enquiry into employment relationships and human resource management. Examining the crucial role of algorithmic management, we critically discuss the impact of this novel mediation tool used by gig organisations for the nature of employment relations within app\u2010work, work assignment processes, and performance management. In so doing, we propose a series of research questions that can serve as a guide for future research in this increasingly important field.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this paper is to discuss the opportunities talent analytics offers HR practitioners. As the availability of methodologies for the analysis of large volumes of data has substantially improved over the last ten years, talent analytics has started to be used by organizations to manage their workforce. This paper discusses the benefits and costs associated with the use of talent analytics within an organization as well as to highlight the differences between talent analytics and other sub-fields of business analytics. It will discuss a number of case studies on how talent analytics can improve organizational decision-making. From the case studies, we will identify key channels through which the adoption of talent analytics can improve the performance of the HR function and eventually of the whole organization. While discussing the opportunities that talent analytics offer organizations, this paper highlights the costs (in terms of data governance and ethics) that the widespread use of talent analytics can generate. Finally, it highlights the importance of trust in supporting the successful implementation of talent analytics projects.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: The aim of this study is to contribute to the understanding of the power of artificial intelligence (AI) in recruitment and to highlight the opportunities and challenges associated with its use. Theoretical framework: This paper provides a comprehensive analytical review of current AI-based recruitment strategies, drawing on both academic research and industry reports. Design/methodology/approach: The paper critically evaluates the potential benefits and drawbacks of using AI in recruitment and assesses the effectiveness of various AI-based recruitment strategies. Findings: The results indicate that AI-based recruitment strategies such as resume screening, candidate matching, video interviewing, chatbots, predictive analytics, gamification, virtual reality assessments, and social media screening offer significant potential benefits for organizations, including improved efficiency, cost savings, and better-quality hires. However, the use of AI in recruitment also raises ethical and legal concerns, including the potential for algorithmic bias and discrimination. Research, Practical &amp; Social implications: The study concludes by emphasizing the need for further research and development to ensure that AI-based recruitment strategies are effective, unbiased, and aligned with ethical and legal standards. Originality/value: The value of the study lies in its comprehensive exploration of AI in recruitment, synthesizing insights from academic and industry perspectives, and assessing the balance of potential benefits against ethical and legal concerns.",

Yet the volume, variety, and velocity of professional involvement among I-O psychologists remains relatively limited when it comes to developing and evaluating AI/ML applications for talent assessment and selection. Furthermore, there is a paucity of empirical research that investigates the reliability, validity, and fairness of AI/ML tools in organizational contexts. To stimulate future involvement and research, we share our review and perspective on the current state of AI/ML in talent assessment as well as its benefits and potential pitfalls; and in addressing the issue of fairness, we present experimental evidence regarding the potential for AI/ML to evoke adverse reactions from job applicants during selection procedures. We close by emphasizing increased collaboration among I-O psychologists, computer scientists, legal scholars, and members of other professional disciplines in developing, implementing, and evaluating AI/ML applications in organizational contexts.",

We have minimised bias and ensured reliable findings by employing a systematic literature review and the PRISMA statement. Our comprehensive synthesis of the studies included in this research, along with a bibliometric analysis of articles, journals, indexes, authors' affiliations, citations, keyword co-occurrences, and co-authorship analysis, has produced robust results. The discussion of our findings focuses on critical areas of interest, such as AI and Talent, AI Bias, Ethics and Law, and their impact on Human Resource (HR) management. Our research highlights the recognition by organisations of the importance of talent management in achieving a competitive advantage as higher-level skills become increasingly necessary. Although some HR managers have adopted AI technology for talent acquisition, our study reveals that there is still room for improvement. Our study is in line with previous research that acknowledges the potential for AI to revolutionise HR management and the future of work. Our findings emphasise the need for HR managers to be proactive in embracing technology and bridging the technological, human, societal, and governmental gaps. Our study contributes to the growing body of AI and HR management knowledge, providing essential insights and recommendations for future research. The importance of our study lies in its focus on the role of HR in promoting the benefits of AI-based applications, thereby creating a larger body of knowledge from an organisational perspective.",

    "abstract": "The study comprehensively reviews artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for addressing algorithmic bias in job hiring. More businesses are using AI in curriculum vitae (CV) screening. While the move improves efficiency in the recruitment process, it is vulnerable to biases, which have adverse effects on organizations and the broader society. This research aims to analyze case studies on AI hiring to demonstrate both successful implementations and instances of bias. It also seeks to evaluate the impact of algorithmic bias and the strategies to mitigate it. The basic design of the study entails undertaking a systematic review of existing literature and research studies that focus on artificial intelligence techniques employed to mitigate bias in hiring. The results demonstrate that the correction of the vector space and data augmentation are effective natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning techniques for mitigating algorithmic bias in hiring. The findings underscore the potential of artificial intelligence techniques in promoting fairness and diversity in the hiring process with the application of artificial intelligence techniques. The study contributes to human resource practice by enhancing hiring algorithms\u2019 fairness. It recommends the need for collaboration between machines and humans to enhance the fairness of the hiring process. The results can help AI developers make algorithmic changes needed to enhance fairness in AI-driven tools. This will enable the development of ethical hiring tools, contributing to fairness in society.",

    "abstract": "Organizations are increasingly turning toward personnel selection tools that rely on artificial intelligence (AI) technologies and machine learning algorithms that, together, intend to predict the future success of employees better than traditional tools. These new forms of assessment include online games, video-based interviews, and big data pulled from many sources, including test responses, test-taking behavior, applications, resumes, and social media. Speedy processing, lower costs, convenient access, and applicant engagement are often and rightfully cited as the practical advantages for using these selection tools. At the same time, however, these tools raise serious concerns about their effectiveness in terms their conceptual relevance to the job, their basis in a job analysis to ensure job relevancy, their measurement characteristics (reliability and stability), their validity in predicting employee-relevant outcomes, their evidence and normative information being updated appropriately, and the associated ethical concerns around what information is being represented to employers and told to job candidates. This paper explores these concerns, concluding with an urgent call to industrial and organizational psychologists to extend existing professional standards for employment testing to these new AI and machine learning based forms of testing, including standards and requirements for their documentation.",

AI can make this improvement a reality. The objective of this study is to discover the new requirements for generating a new AI-oriented artefact so that the issues pertaining to talent management are effectively addressed. The design artefact is an intelligent Human Resource Management (HRM) automation solution for talent career management primarily based on a talent intelligent module. Improving connections between professional assessment and planning features is the key goal of this initiative. Utilising a design science methodology we investigate the use of organised machine learning approaches. This technique is the key component of a complete AI solution framework that would be further informed through a suggested moderation of technology-organisation-environment (TOE) theory with the theory of diffusion of innovation (DOI). This framework was devised in order solve AI-related problems. Aside from the automated components available in talent management solutions, this study will make recommendations for practical approaches researchers may follow to fulfil a company\u2019s specific requirements for talent growth.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this paper is to investigate how Artificial Intelligence (AI) decision-making transparency affects humans\u2019 trust in AI. Previous studies have shown inconsistent conclusions about the relationship between AI transparency and humans\u2019 trust in AI (i.e., a positive correlation, non-correlation, or an inverted U-shaped relationship). Based on the stimulus-organism-response (SOR) model, algorithmic reductionism, and social identity theory, this paper explores the impact of AI decision-making transparency on humans\u2019 trust in AI from cognitive and emotional perspectives. A total of 235 participants with previous work experience were recruited online to complete the experimental vignette. The results showed that employees\u2019 perceived transparency, employees\u2019 perceived effectiveness of AI, and employees\u2019 discomfort with AI played mediating roles in the relationship between AI decision-making transparency and employees\u2019 trust in AI. Specifically, AI decision-making transparency (vs. non-transparency) led to higher perceived transparency, which in turn increased both effectiveness (which promoted trust) and discomfort (which inhibited trust). This parallel multiple mediating effect can partly explain the inconsistent findings in previous studies on the relationship between AI transparency and humans\u2019 trust in AI. This research has practical significance because it puts forward suggestions for enterprises to improve employees\u2019 trust in AI, so that employees can better collaborate with AI.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In recent years Artificial Intelligence (AI) has gained much popularity, with the scientific community as well as with the public. Often, AI is ascribed many positive impacts for different social domains such as medicine and the economy. On the other side, there is also growing concern about its precarious impact on society and individuals, respectively. Several opinion polls frequently query the public fear of autonomous robots and artificial intelligence, a phenomenon coming also into scholarly focus. As potential threat perceptions arguably vary with regard to the reach and consequences of AI functionalities and the domain of application, research still lacks necessary precision of a respective measurement that allows for wide-spread research applicability. We propose a fine-grained scale to measure threat perceptions of AI that accounts for four functional classes of AI systems and is applicable to various domains of AI applications. Using a standardized questionnaire in a survey study (N = 891), we evaluate the scale over three distinct AI domains (medical treatment, job recruitment, and loan origination). The data support the dimensional structure of the proposed Threats of AI (TAI) scale as well as the internal consistency and factoral validity of the indicators. Implications of the results and the empirical application of the scale are discussed in detail. Recommendations for further empirical use of the TAI scale are provided.",

While AI has great potential to augment the HRM activities in organizations, automating the management of humans is not without risks and limitations. The identification of these risks is fundamental to promote responsible use of AI in HRM. We thus conducted a review of the empirical academic literature across disciplines on the affordances and responsible principles of AI in HRM. This is the first review of responsible AI in HRM that focuses solely on studies containing observations, measurements, and tests about this phenomenon. The multi-domain and multidisciplinary approach and empirical focus provides a better understanding of the reality of the development, study, and deployment of AI in HRM and sheds light on how these are conducted responsibly. We conclude with a call for research based on what we identified as the most needed and promising avenues.",

Based on existing literature, we developed and validated the algorithmic management questionnaire (AMQ) to measure the perceptions of workers regarding their level of exposure to AM. Across three samples (overall n = 1332 gig workers), we show the content, factorial, discriminant, convergent, and predictive validity of the scale. The final 20\u2010item scale assesses workers' perceived level of exposure to algorithmic: monitoring, goal setting, scheduling, performance rating, and compensation. These dimensions formed a higher order construct assessing overall exposure to algorithmic management, which was found to be, as expected, negatively related to the work characteristics of job autonomy and job complexity and, indirectly, to work engagement. Supplementary analyses revealed that perceptions of exposure to AM reflect the objective presence of AM dimensions beyond individual variations in exposure. Overall, the results suggest the suitability of the AMQ to assess workers' perceived exposure to algorithmic management, which paves the way for further research on the impacts of these rapidly accelerating systems.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "Background/purpose: In the digital age, education is no longer considered an activity carried out during a specific period of life, but rather a lifelong concept. The skills acquired through formal education processes can become obsolete within a few years due to the rapid pace of the era. It is precisely at this point that corporate structures are under more pressure than ever to keep their employees' skills up to date. These training programmes are conducted with intensive use of educational technologies in order to prevent workforce loss and provide training at an appropriate cost. In the field of corporate learning and development, the impact of artificial intelligence technologies on employee training is also increasing. Materials/methods: This article systematically examines the effects, opportunities, and challenges of AI applications in employee training. The field of artificial intelligence applications in education has been evaluated within a theoretical framework, and articles published between 2020 and 2025 have been analysed using a systematic review and a thematic content analysis, focusing on impacts, opportunities, and challenges. Results: The analysis revealed that artificial intelligence affects cognitive, affective, behavioural, and technical-organisational dimensions of employee training. Opportunities were reported in learning quality, cognitive development, affective and social aspects, performance and efficiency, and organisational aspects, while challenges were reported in technical, infrastructure, ethics and law, organisational, and pedagogical dimensions. Conclusion: Artificial intelligence is expected to make significant contributions to employee training. However, many areas identified as challenges need to be addressed in order to maximise the benefits of these technologies.",

      "Angela Jackson"
    ],
    "year": 2024,
    "abstract": "This study investigates the perspectives of University Human Resource Administrators in Tennessee regarding the integration of generative AI technologies in higher education. Focusing on administrators within the College & University Professional Association for HR TN Chapter, the research employed a mixed-methods approach, utilizing pre- and post-test surveys and open-ended questions to gauge awareness, understanding, and perceptions of generative AI. While quantitative data revealed a general awareness of AI, it also exposed knowledge gaps regarding specific applications and implications for HR practices. Qualitative findings illustrated a spectrum of perceptions, with some administrators enthusiastic about AI's potential to streamline tasks and enhance employee experiences. In contrast, others expressed concerns about privacy, ethics, and job security. Guided by the Technology Acceptance Model, the study emphasizes the importance of perceived usefulness and ease of use in driving AI. Findings underscore the need for targeted training and professional development initiatives to equip HR administrators with the knowledge and skills necessary to integrate generative AI effectively. Recommendations include developing AI literacy programs, establishing ethical guidelines for AI implementation, and incorporating AI-related competencies into HR practices. This study provides valuable insights for higher education institutions nationwide as they navigate the complexities of integrating generative AI into their human resource management strategies.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes action learning has a role to play in advancing responsible AI. Despite the recent surge in attention towards artificial intelligence, predominantly focusing on its technological and commercial aspects, the social dimensions have often been overlooked. Action learning, known for fostering interdisciplinary discourse, is proposed as a collaborative learning approach to foster responsible AI. The paper explores three potential avenues: facilitating multidisciplinary dialogue, reshaping the workforce, and promoting ethical AI practices. Emphasising the importance of cultivating critical questioning skills, we suggest an action learning approach can cultivate the innovative potential of AI, whilst mitigating its potential risks.",

    "abstract": "Even while Artificial Intelligence (AI) has long been a part of our lives, it has recently received more attention thanks to the introduction of ChatGPT, a Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer, since its launch in November 2022. The focus of this study is to investigate the potential of ChatGPT to assess student-teacher learning, which looks at its use for online assessments in South Africa. It emphasizes South African lecturers' views of ChatGPT, an AI technology used for designing online assessments. The expansion of online assessments has brought about various adaptable tools and techniques, and ChatGPT provides benefits, including real-time interaction and personalized responses. Nevertheless, problems such as prejudices and circumstantial limitations still exist. Notwithstanding this, ChatGPT does well at assessing critical thinking by examining evidence-based reasoning and logical reliability. When integrating ChatGPT, ethical deliberations such as algorithmic transparency, data security, and privacy are crucial. Ten participants participated in a qualitative study that examined ChatGPT's effects on online assessment and student-teacher relationships using the Community of Inquiry (CoI) model. By presenting lecturers with AI-driven techniques and promoting innovation and technology integration, participants highlight their impact in promoting professional development. As a cooperative tool, ChatGPT offers tailored feedback, detailed instructions, and culturally appropriate rubrics that encourage critical thinking and introspection. It is essential, however, to contextualize its application to combat biases and cultural twists within the African educational environment. This ensures that rather than replacing student-teachers' knowledge, AI supports them using inclusive and valuable assessments.",

    "abstract": "Technologies like ChatGPT and other AI tools have impacted learning by giving students more chances to ask questions and explore knowledge. The inclusion of Non-Player Characters (NPCs) as scaffolding in game-based situated learning activities can have a positive impact on learning. The application of ChatGPT to role-playing has potential; therefore, this study designed a \"ChatGPT-based NPCs scaffolding Workflow Framework\" and used it as the basis for designing and evaluating an educational game for employee ethics training with empirical evidence. This study had 61 participants, divided into a document scaffolding group (n = 32) and a ChatGPT-based NPC group (n = 29) and examined the learning achievement, flow, motivation, and anxiety in the two groups. The results showed that the designs of both groups benefited learning achievement, and both groups could maintain a certain level of high motivation and engagement. Through qualitatively analyzing the content of students' discussions with NPCs, it was found that there is potential for NPC-assisted learning through ChatGPT. Overall, this study explored the efficacy and limitations of using ChatGPT-based NPCs as scaffolding in game-based learning and found that it is extensible. We also present a framework for the design of ChatGPT-based NPCs scaffolding mechanism.",

AB  - The increasing integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in educational settings is transforming the role of school leaders, reshaping how decisions are made, and introducing both opportunities and challenges. This paper presents the findings of a scoping review that synthesises the current literature on AI's impact on educational leadership. The review highlights that while AI has the potential to enhance decision-making through data-driven insights and automation of administrative tasks, its implementation requires careful consideration of ethical, equity, and human-centred concerns. Key findings suggest that educational leaders must develop digital literacy and AI competence to critically assess AI outputs and mitigate risks, particularly related to algorithmic bias and data privacy. The review also emphasises the necessity of continuous professional development for leaders and staff to ensure effective and ethical AI integration. In light of these findings, this paper advocates for a balanced approach where AI is used to augment, rather than replace, the human elements of leadership, and calls for future empirical research to further investigate the long-term implications of AI in diverse educational contexts.

AB  - This qualitative case study explored graduate students' views (n=6) on AI-supported applications and an AI-enabled blockbased coding tool (PictoBlox) in science education. Data were gathered over a 39-hour implementation via a semi-structured interview form and screen captures from the activities, and analyzed with content analysis. Participants perceived AI tools as time-saving and pedagogically enriching, while emphasizing ethics and data security. PictoBlox's AI add-ons (e.g., natural language processing, image processing, machine learning) were seen to support concretization, visualization, and interactive content creation. Reported challenges concerned activity design and block creation skills. We discuss implications for teacher education, including targeted training on AI-supported lesson planning and assessment design, and guidance on ethical/data-protection practices. Limitations (convenience sampling, small n, self-report) constrain generalizability. Future research should replicate with larger, diverse cohorts and triangulate with classroom observations.

AB  - This study aimed to propose a Professional Development Model (PDM) for chemistry teachers to enhance their professional development in Artificial Intelligence (AI). The research group consisted of 17 chemistry teachers. The study was designed using a particular case study suitable for qualitative research methods. Document review, teacher interviews, and AI opinions were utilized to create the model. Data were analyzed using inductive content analysis. The document analysis emphasized the teachers' knowledge of various topics, such as AI knowledge, AI tools, AI skills, AI ethics, AI attitudes, and AI literacy, to enable them to incorporate AI into their lessons. It was also highlighted that teachers should acquire domain-specific knowledge, skills, and competencies in the areas where artificial intelligence will be integrated. When examining the recommendations of artificial intelligence (ChatGPT and Gemini), it was found that they addressed similar content to the information included in the document analysis. Furthermore, chemistry teachers stated their deficiencies in AI literacy, AI competencies, and developing AI lesson plans. They also stated that AI applications could be included in various subjects such as organic chemistry, chemical experiments, and chemical reactions. Following the analysis of documents and teacher and AI opinions, a 10-step PDM has been proposed to enhance chemistry teachers' professional development in AI.

AB  - As the use of artificial intelligence (AI), especially machine learning (ML), has dramatically increased, K-12 schools have begun to deliver AI education; however, little is known about teachers' views on the field. This qualitative study investigated how U.S. high school computer science (CS) teachers conceptualize AI, the role of AI in their CS instruction, and the instructional curricula and pedagogies these educators use to bring AI into their CS instruction. Data was collected through semi-structured interviews with 23 educators teaching 9-12th grade CS courses in U.S. schools. Data collected from interviews was examined using thematic analysis resulting in seven themes. The findings suggest that teachers see great value in AI education and encourage schools to provide AI literacy instruction for all students while providing AI technical instruction in elective CS courses. Teachers demonstrated high levels of interest in the field but a shallow understanding of AI technology. The study's findings also showed that CS teachers know of the importance of AI ethics instruction but have a limited view of AI's impact on society. Additionally, the results point to a general lack of curricula and tools designed to teach K-12 students about AI, especially materials that emphasize critique of AI technology and its societal harms. The study's results contribute to a deeper understanding of 9-12th grade teachers' conceptions of AI and the challenges they face when implementing AI instruction. Implications for teachers, school leaders, curriculum developers, policy makers, teacher educators, and professional development (PD) providers are presented.

AB  - Uncovering patterns and trends in vast, ever-increasing quantities of data has been enabled by different machine learning methods and techniques used in Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. Permeating many aspects of our lives and influencing our choices, development in this field continues to advance and increasingly impacts us as individuals and our society. The risks and unintended effects such as bias from input data or algorithm design have recently stirred discourse about how to inform and teach AI in K-12 education. As AI is a new topic not only for pupils in K-12 but also for teachers, new skill sets are required that enable critical engagement with AI. AI literacy is trying to close the gap between research and practical knowledge transfer of AI-related skills. Teachers' AI-related technological, pedagogical and content knowledge (TPACK) are important factors for AI literacy. However, as teachers' perspectives, beliefs and views impact both the interpretation and operationalisation of curriculum. this study explores teachers' and teacher educators' understanding and preconceptions of AI to inform teacher education and professional development. To gain a comprehensive understanding of teachers' conceptualisations regarding AI an anonymous questionnaire together with focus group discussions were employed. The qualitative content analysis underpinned by the theoretical framework Intelligent TPACK reveals that teachers' AI-related content knowledge is generally gained through incidental learning and often results in pre- and misconceptions of AI. Our analysis also revealed several potential challenges for teachers in achieving core constructs of Intelligent TPACK, examples of such challenges are vague and unclear guidelines in both policy and curriculum, a lack of understanding of AI and its limitations, as well as emotional responses related to participants' preconceptions. These insights are important to consider in designing teacher education and professional development related to AI literacy.

AB  - This paper presents a policy framework to position New Jersey as a national leader in artificial intelligence (AI) education and workforce development. Through analysis of current state initiatives--including the NJ AI Hub, AI Task Force reports, apprenticeship programs, and regulatory guidance--we identify gaps and opportunities across K-12, higher education, and workforce development sectors. We propose a multi-layered approach visualized through interconnected frameworks: an integrated AI education ecosystem, phased implementation roadmaps for K-12 AI literacy, a statewide AI curriculum consortium structure, multi-track workforce development pathways, and equity and access frameworks. Quantitative analysis reveals that while 20-25%+ of New Jersey's workforce already uses AI technology daily, only 20-25% of educators feel prepared for AI integration. Our policy recommendations address this gap through a $165 million annual investment strategy with projected 3.8x return on investment, creating pathways for 15,000-20,000 new AI jobs by 2030. Recommendations include more layered, interconnected and framework-styled methods for establishing AI literacy standards for all K-12 students, creating specialized AI high schools, expanding community college AI programs, developing industry-aligned university curricula, and implementing statewide AI teacher training. We also address equity and risk considerations, funding mechanisms, and suggested implementation timelines. This is a pure review paper and all findings are from suggested literature.

AB  - The current study aimed to criticize the existing literature on the utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in teaching and learning chemistry. A comprehensive critical literature review was conducted using electronic databases such as Scopus, PubMed, ISI, Google Scholar, ERIC, Web of Science, and JSTOR. In this regard, 62 articles were extracted from these electronic databases. During the selection of the literature inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied. The inclusion criteria include empirical and theoretical studies examining the effectiveness, challenges, and opportunities of AI/ML, and articles from 2018 to 2024 and written in English. On the other side, the exclusion criteria include literature that unrelated to education, lacking empirical evidence, or not peer-reviewed, as well as non-English publications, and published before 2018. This was done to gain insights into the current implementation status of AI and ML as well as critical issues of using these approaches in chemistry education. The study employed a critical review of the literature, which involves a critical analysis of the themes and concepts that emerge from the selected literature and identifies the opportunities and challenges surrounding the utilization of these technologies. The results revealed that there are opportunities for the integration of AI and ML in chemistry education, including personalized learning experiences, teacher assistance, and accessibility to learning materials. In this regard, intelligent tutoring systems and adaptive learning platforms were identified as potential aides for teachers in various aspects of teaching. The study also revealed the limitations and challenges surrounding AI and ML, such as the dependence on preexisting data, potential biases in models, and concerns around data privacy and security. Moreover, the findings also indicated that the implementation of AI and ML in chemistry education is still in its juvenile stage. Thus, teacher training programs are needed to equip teachers with the necessary skills for the use of these technologies effectively in the classroom. In addition, more efforts should be made to facilitate research, collaboration, and the development of policies and regulations that ensure responsible use of these technologies in the teaching and learning process.

The search strategy was structured into five categories aligned with the research questions to identify relevant studies accurately. The selection process was carried out in three phases -- Identification, Screening, and Inclusion -- applying predefined criteria to guarantee the quality and relevance of the selected studies. Of an initial total of 514,919 articles, 488,940 were excluded for not meeting the inclusion criteria. After removing duplicates and evaluating titles, abstracts, and full texts, a final set of 28 studies was included. Contribution: The study explores the integration of AI in primary education, revealing both teachers' enthusiasm and the challenges they face. While AI is perceived as a tool to enhance critical thinking, problem-solving, and student engagement, its implementation is limited by insufficient training, resources, and institutional support. Despite these obstacles, teachers show confidence in designing AI-integrated curricula, though this is weakened by inadequate infrastructure and technical support, highlighting the need for continuous professional development. The study also stresses the importance of establishing a competency framework for AI literacy and adopting a systemic approach to AI education. Additionally, ensuring safe learning environments by addressing data privacy and AI biases remains a key challenge. Overcoming these issues is essential for the ethical and effective integration of AI, maximizing its benefits while safeguarding student equity and security. Findings: (1) Educators see the potential of AI to personalize learning; (2) Barriers are lack of training and resources for teachers; (3) Importance of continuous training in digital skills; (4) Need for policies that promote AI literacy; and (5) Collaboration with experts to optimize AI in the classroom. Recommendations for Practitioners: Teachers are encouraged to collaborate in using AI tools to enhance educational outcomes, supported by continuous professional development programs, clear policies that safeguard privacy and promote equality, and a framework that preserves human autonomy in integrating AI technologies. Recommendation for Researchers: The lack of empirical research on AI interventions in education limits understanding of its true impact, highlighting the need for future studies to fill this gap and optimize its application for greater educational benefits. Impact on Society: The integration of AI in K-12 education is not just an opportunity; it is a necessity to prepare future generations for an increasingly digital world. While AI has the potential to revolutionize learning by fostering critical thinking, personalization, and engagement, its impact depends on how effectively it is implemented. To ensure its benefits, it is essential to empower educators and students with AI literacy, address issues like bias and data privacy, and establish robust legal frameworks for fair and transparent use. Without proactive policies, AI could widen educational inequalities instead of reducing them. A responsible, human-centered approach is needed to create an inclusive, ethical, and effective AI-powered education system. Future Research: The article highlights the urgency of future empirical research to better understand the real impact of AI in education, as the lack of intervention studies limits its optimal application. Analyzing how AI influences learning outcomes, teaching dynamics, equity, and accessibility is essential, along with investigating the pedagogical competencies and technological conditions that affect its adoption. To this end, expanding the scope of studies is recommended by incorporating multicultural and multilingual perspectives, exploring AI applications across various disciplines and educational levels, and promoting interdisciplinary approaches that address ethical, social, and pedagogical dimensions.

AB  - In this analysis, we review artificial intelligence (AI)-supported personalized learning (PL) systems, with an emphasis on pedagogical approaches and implementation challenges. We searched the Web of Science and Scopus databases. After the preliminary review, we examined 30 publications in detail. ChatGPT and machine learning technologies are among the most often utilized tools; studies show that general education and language learning account for the majority of AI applications in the field of education. Supported by particular learning approaches stressing student characteristics and expectations, the results show that automated feedback systems and adaptive content distribution define AI's educational responsibilities mostly. The study notes major difficulties in three areas: technical constraints and data privacy concerns; educational and pragmatic barriers. Although curriculum integration and teacher preparation are considered major concerns, pedagogical challenges come first above technology integration. The results also underline the need for thorough professional development activities for teachers and AI tools for especially targeted instruction. The study shows that the efficient application of AI-enabled PL requires a comprehensive strategy addressing technological, pedagogical, and ethical issues all at once. These results help to describe the current state of AI in education and provide ideas for future developments as well as techniques for its use.

AB  - Artificial intelligence technologies have become a ubiquitous part of human life. This prompts us to ask, "how should we live well with artificial intelligence?" Currently, the most prominent candidate answers to this question are principlist. According to these approaches, if you teach people some finite set of principles or convince them to adopt the right rules, people will be able to live and act well with artificial intelligence, even in an evolving and opaque moral world. We find the dominant principlist approaches to be ill-suited to providing forward-looking moral guidance regarding living well with artificial intelligence. We analyze some of the proposed principles to show that they oscillate between being too vague and too specific. We also argue that such rules are unlikely to be flexible enough to adapt to rapidly changing circumstances. By contrast, we argue for an Aristotelian virtue ethics approach to artificial intelligence ethics. Aristotelian virtue ethics provides a concrete and actionable guidance that is also flexible; thus, it is uniquely well placed to deal with the forward-looking and rapidly changing landscape of life with artificial intelligence. However, virtue ethics is agent-based rather than action-based. Using virtue ethics as a basis for living well with artificial intelligence requires ensuring that at least some virtuous agents also possess the relevant scientific and technical expertise. Since virtue ethics does not prescribe a set of rules, it requires exemplars who can serve as a model for those learning to be virtuous. Cultivating virtue is challenging, especially in the absence of moral sages. Despite this difficulty, we think the best option is to attempt what virtue ethics requires, even though no system of training can guarantee the production of virtuous agents. We end with two alternative visions -- one from each of the two authors -- about the practicality of such an approach.

AB  - We have dramatically advanced our ability to create rich, complex, and effective assessments across a range of uses through technology advancement. Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled assessments represent one such area of advancement--one that has captured our collective interest and imagination. Scientists and practitioners within the domains of organizational and workforce assessment have increasingly used AI in assessment, and its use is now becoming more common in education. While these types of solutions offer their users the promise of efficiency, effectiveness, and a "wow factor," users need to maintain high standards for validity and fairness in high stakes settings. Due to the complexity of some AI methods and tools, this requirement for adherence to standards may challenge our traditional approaches to building validity and fairness arguments. In this edition, we review what these challenges may look like as validity arguments meet AI in educational assessment domains. We specifically explore how AI impacts Evidence-Centered Design (ECD) and development from assessment concept and coding to scoring and reporting. We also present information on ways to ensure that bias is not built into these systems. Lastly, we discuss future horizons, many that are almost here, for maximizing what AI offers while minimizing negative effects on test takers and programs.

AB  - This study examines the pedagogical, ethical, and political dimensions of artificial intelligence (AI) in early childhood STEM education from a theoretical perspective. As digital technologies become increasingly prevalent in education, AI applications offer significant opportunities in areas such as personalized learning experiences, game-based education, and data analytics. However, they also pose critical ethical concerns, including data security, algorithmic bias, and privacy, while influencing children's cognitive, linguistic, and social development. Drawing on Piaget's theory of active discovery and learning, Vygotsky's emphasis on social interaction and teacher guidance, and Bronfenbrenner's ecological systems theory, this study explores how AI-supported learning environments can enrich children's natural developmental processes. A qualitative literature review and theoretical analysis reveal the necessity of achieving a balanced integration between the individualized educational opportunities offered by AI and the potential risks it entails. The findings highlight the critical importance of developing human-centered, ethically sound, and inclusive educational models for educators, policymakers, and researchers in the face of technological transformation. In this context, teacher training, parental collaboration, and interdisciplinary strategies are identified as fundamental prerequisites for the sustainable and effective integration of AI in early childhood education.

AB  - This study investigated K-12 educators' perceptions of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in teaching and learning, examining how teachers use and evaluate GenAI tools in relation to student thinking and classroom practices. Grounded in Bloom's Taxonomy (1956) and Ritchhart's (2015) Cultures of Thinking framework, the survey of 73 teachers revealed that while most participants use GenAI for instructional design and administrative efficiency, far fewer employ it to foster higher-order cognitive processes such as application, analysis, and evaluation. Teachers reported benefits in lesson planning and differentiation but expressed concerns about accuracy, ethics, and overreliance. Findings highlighted a critical need for professional development that integrates technical proficiency with pedagogical strategies for using GenAI to promote application, critical thinking, and deeper student learning. The study underscores that GenAI's educational potential remains underrealized without intentional alignment to human-centered teaching goals.

AB  - This study explores university educators' perspectives on their alignment with artificial intelligence (AI) ethics, considering activity theory (AT), which forms the theoretical underpinning of this study. To do so, 37 educators from a higher education institution were selected to write their metaphors about AI ethics alignment, out of which 11 attended semi-structured interviews, in which they answered some questions about their AI ethics alignment and narrated some experiences. The study reveals diverse and often contradictory perspectives on AI ethics, highlighting a general lack of awareness and inconsistent application of ethical principles. Some educators metaphorised AI ethics as fundamental but difficult to understand, while others pointed to the difficulties of regulating ethical violations. The findings highlight the need for targeted professional development on AI ethics, collaborative policy making and a multidisciplinary approach to promote ethical use of AI in higher education. This study also calls for stronger alignment between educators' personal ethical standards and institutional norms to reduce AI-related risks in educational settings.

AB  - The rapid development of Generative Artificial Intelligence in education presents new opportunities but also raises concerns about inequality and the integrity of academic practices. This study explores its impact, trends, and risks in education through an extensive review of existing academic literature. The methodology includes a systematic review conducted via the Scopus platform, incorporating documentary analysis with descriptive statistics, systematic content analysis, and bibliometric analysis of citations, co-citations, and co-words in scientific research on the topic. Network maps were created using VOSviewer, and graphs were produced with Microsoft Excel. Moreover, qualitative content analysis was further deepened using ATLAS.ti, .24. The major findings indicate that generative artificial intelligence, as a set of information-processing tools, has significantly advanced over the past century, especially notable for its ability to process information quickly and adapt to human objectives. Its rapid adaptation is transforming education, particularly by enhancing personalization, improving knowledge retention, and supporting interactive learning environments. However, the use of GenAI also raises ethical and equity concerns, including risks to academic integrity, data privacy, and potential algorithmic bias, alongside challenges in ensuring equitable access and adequate teacher training. The main focus of current applications lies in commercial, collaborative, and natural language strategies, which surpass other uses such as images and videos. GenAI aligns with pedagogical theories that promote student autonomy, active learning, and collaboration, if implemented with clear educational intent. However, since machines lack human social perception, it is necessary to reflect critically on the ethical boundaries and appropriate use of AI in the linguistic and educational domains. Gen AI offers transformative potential for education by enabling personalized and efficient learning; however, addressing associated risks, ethical challenges, and issues of equity is essential to ensure its benefits are realized without compromising academic integrity or exacerbating inequalities.

AB  - The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming higher education, impacting pedagogical practices, administrative processes, and faculty engagement with technology. While AI holds promise to enhance learning and streamlining operations, its adoption remains complex and debated. This study examines faculty perceptions of AI integration, focusing on factors such as teaching experience, institutional context, and disciplinary specialization. Using a quantitative survey, the research explores AI engagement across institutions and disciplines, analyzing how demographic factors influence adoption. Findings suggest that junior faculty and those in technology-driven environments demonstrate higher AI confidence and adoption, whereas senior faculty engage in AI leadership yet express skepticism about its pedagogical applications. Disciplinary differences reveal that faculty in content-based fields view AI as a teaching tool, while those in applied disciplines utilize it more strategically for administrative and leadership functions. The study also addresses ethical and institutional challenges, including concerns over data privacy, algorithmic bias, and institutional readiness. By identifying these barriers, the research highlights strategies for fostering AI literacy, professional development, and ethical implementation in higher education. This study contributes to the discourse on AI in academia by presenting an educator-centered perspective, bridging the gap between technological advancement and pedagogical practice. The findings provide academic leaders and policymakers with insights on creating AI-inclusive environments that align with faculty needs, uphold ethical standards, and enhance student learning outcomes.

AB  - This study explores interconnections between university teachers' self-efficacy beliefs, intrinsic motivation, behavioural commitment, and teachers' views on the ethics of AI and the possibilities of using AI in teaching. Furthermore, the aim is to investigate how teachers' teaching experience and their participation in AI training relate to these aspects. The data consist of teachers' (n=92) survey responses and open-ended answers. Data analyses included both quantitative and qualitative methods. The quantitative data were analysed with correlations, t-test, and ANOVA, while content analysis was used to analyse the qualitative data. The results indicated that teachers emphasized the importance of ethical perspectives on AI. A positive connection was found between university teachers' self-efficacy for using AI in teaching, intrinsic motivation, and behavioural commitment. Teachers with AI training reported higher self-efficacy for using AI in teaching, and they had significantly higher levels of intrinsic motivation and behavioural commitment than teachers without AI training. Moreover, they highlighted more possibilities for using AI in planning their teaching and supporting student learning than teachers without AI training. This study enhances understanding of how university teachers' self-efficacy, intrinsic motivation, and behavioural commitment to using AI in teaching are interrelated, highlighting the potential moderating role of AI training participation.

AB  - This study explores generative mechanisms of curriculum design from a human-centred perspective, with a focus on the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into engineering education. As curricula evolve to meet the demands of a technologically advanced and globally connected society, it is crucial to preserve the educational values rooted in human agency, cultural context, and pedagogical reasoning. The research aimed to investigate how traditional curriculum development processes can be enhanced through AI tools while preserving the essential role of human educators. A mixed-method approach was used, combining quantitative Likert-scale surveys and qualitative open-ended responses from 43 participants involved in curriculum development and implementation across higher and vocational education and industry. The results show that AI is perceived as highly effective in automating administrative tasks and personalizing learning, but concerns remain about ethical issues, data privacy, and potential marginalization of human educators. Most respondents emphasized that AI should serve as a supportive tool rather than a replacement. The findings underscore the importance of hybrid curriculum models that integrate AI for operational efficiency while maintaining human agency in decision-making, pedagogy, and ethical oversight. The study offers practical implications for future curriculum reforms and teacher training in an AI-enhanced educational landscape. [For the complete proceedings, see ED673688.]

AB  - Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) and generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) technology have rapidly evolved in recent years, posing substantial implications for counselors, counselor educators, supervisors, and researchers. However, research on AI and counseling is in its infancy, and while some counseling organizations have recently published AI-related standards, none have been published within some counseling specializations, such as rehabilitation counseling. Objectives: This article aims to (a) introduce counselors to AI and GenAI, (b) review the benefits and risks of AI and GenAI for counseling practice, education, and research, (c) summarize emerging AI-related standards from national counseling organizations, and (d) present AI-related recommendations for rehabilitation counseling professionals. Methods: A literature review was conducted, synthesizing peer-reviewed articles, ethical codes, and emerging guidelines from national counseling organizations. Examples of AI and GenAI applications in counseling, counselor education, supervision, documentation, psychoeducation, and therapy support were integrated. A GenAI model (ChatGPT-4) was used to codevelop AI-related recommendations for rehabilitation counselors. Findings: Potentially beneficial uses of AI in counseling include proofreading of documentation; enhanced learning and research; improved case management and case documentation; graphic design for educational materials; strategic referral finding; enhanced data analysis; psychoeducation; and therapeutic chatbots and therapy homework. Challenges and harms include biased and inaccurate information; over-reliance on AI; security, privacy, and confidentiality concerns; harmful relationships with AI; and environmental impact. Conclusions: AI and GenAI offer both promise and peril for counseling. Ethical use requires professional competency, transparency, critical evaluation of AI outputs, and safeguards for client welfare. Twelve recommendations are offered to guide rehabilitation counseling professionals in maximizing benefits while minimizing harm.

AB  - Generative AI holds transformative potential for education but also introduces ethical and pedagogical complexities, thereby necessitating comprehensive teacher preparation. To investigate whether mindset-oriented professional development (PD), beyond tool-focused training alone, enhances teachers' responsible AI use, we conducted a mixed-method study comparing two PD approaches with 57 preservice teachers. Participants were randomly assigned to either a tools-only training group or a combined tools-and-mindset training group, including modules on AI ethics, human-centered education, and pedagogical reflection. Results revealed that both groups experienced decreased AI anxiety; yet only the tools-only group reported statistically significant gains in self-efficacy across multiple AI competence domains. Conversely, the mindset group exhibited a targeted increase in human-centered AI competence, reflecting deeper ethical awareness and critical reflection. Qualitative analysis confirmed that mindset-trained teachers articulated more subtle concerns about AI's risks and pedagogical implications, adopting a more cautious stance and expressing a desire for further ethics-focused training. This study provides empirical evidence that embedding mindset components into AI-focused PD fosters essential reflective capacities and ethical judgment. Effective teacher PD should thus integrate technical proficiency with ethics, human-centered design, and critical pedagogy, cultivating educators capable of responsibly integrating AI in classrooms.

AB  - As part of an international collaborative design-based research initiative, this study examines the applications and perceptions of generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI) among pre-service primary teachers within an Irish educational program. It focuses on how personal and academic uses of Gen AI influence their perceptions of using Gen AI for lesson planning. The findings highlight that while Gen AI is preliminarily used by pre-service primary teachers for personal and academic purposes, its integration into lesson planning is less frequent. Crucially, the study reveals no significant correlations between personal use of Gen AI and perceptions related to its educational opportunities. Conversely, academic use of Gen AI shows a positive correlation with recognising its potential opportunities for lesson planning and the desire for professional development, but it also shows a negative correlation with the perception of challenges and ethical concerns. The research underscores substantial concerns about over-reliance on Gen AI, potential skill diminishment, educational equity, and data privacy. These findings emphasise the urgent need for targeted professional development programmes to prepare future teachers to use Gen AI tools effectively and ethically, highlighting a gap in current teacher education that must be addressed to harness the full potential of Gen AI in education.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated effectiveness in various educational contexts, offering adaptive evaluation mechanisms, personalized learning experiences, and increased learner engagement (Holstein et al., 2019; Woolf, 2019). This study examined the experiences of community college faculty incorporating AI technologies in teaching practices, how faculty engaged first-generation adult learners when incorporating AI technologies, and how AI technologies were addressed in college documents and policies. Given the context of this research, the chosen methodology for this study was a qualitative case study design comprised of interviews with faculty from a single-district multicampus site in the United States. The interviews were semi-structured to allow the researcher to gather information on the experiences of faculty incorporating AI technologies into their teaching practices. The semi-structured interview method provided a fitting structure to explore the rich, complex, and detailed description of the experiences of community college faculty incorporating AI technologies in teaching practices. The researcher examined institutional archival documents to supplement semi-structured interviews and increase the credibility and reliability of the analyses. The researcher determined how AI technologies were addressed in institutional documents and policies using Huber's (1993) organizational change theory as the theoretical framework and Rogers' (1995) diffusion of innovation as the conceptual framework. Faculty concluded that AI could improve the quality of teaching practices by addressing uncertainties, bridging the digital divide, and promoting technology acceptance. Participants acknowledged that AI can foster creativity, facilitate experimental learning, support professional development, and enhance training to improve learner outcomes in the classroom. However,&#xa0;some faculty expressed concerns about integrating AI into teaching. Participants cited the potential long-term impact of learner critical thinking. They acknowledged that generative AI technology is limited and can create misleading or skewed information due to bias and hallucinations affecting student learning. Furthermore, faculty acknowledged the existence of the digital divide and its impact on first-generation learners. The participants agreed that first-generation learners could use AI technologies at the same levels as non-first-generation learners. However, some faculty noticed that first-generation learners associated guilt with AI usage or became hesitant to use the technology when the information generated was incorrect. Further research and ongoing support is necessary to continue advancing the integration of AI tools into educational practices. The findings of this study inform community college faculty about the multifaceted nature of integrating AI technologies into teaching practices. Community colleges interested in implementing or expanding faculty's use of AI in teaching practices could create a task force to develop policies and best practices and review and monitor academic integrity, ethical use, data privacy, and bias. Additionally, the institution can allocate resources for faculty professional development and training and launch pilot programs to learn how to use AI technologies in select areas.

AB  - This study explores how English language teachers use shared repertoire in virtual communities of practice (VCoPs) when integrating artificial intelligence (AI) tools into teaching. Using a qualitative analysis of discussions from three open Facebook groups, this study identifies how teachers actively collaborate online to share practical strategies and resources related to AI. The findings indicate that shared repertoire in these groups serves four main purposes: supporting teaching activities, assessing students, sharing relevant resources, and suggesting improvements to AI tools. Teachers also discuss common challenges, including excessive reliance on AI, privacy issues, limited access to AI resources, and the risk of reduced teacher-student interactions. The study highlights that teachers' collective experiences within these online communities can help institutions develop more relevant training programs for teachers. Overall, this research confirms that while AI can support language education, its successful integration relies on teachers sharing experiences and guiding each other on how to best use this technology to enhance their teaching.

AB  - This study examines how DALL-E 3 interprets English descriptions written by Indonesian university students. Sixteen descriptive texts were submitted to the artificial intelligence (AI) tool, and the resulting images were compared to original photos. Most outputs showed clear mismatches. The analysis found that misinterpretations originated from two main sources: grammatical and vocabulary patterns reflecting Indonesian English and broader stylistic choices, such as the use of vague, emotional, or abstract language. The study also found that a high level of concrete detail could often mitigate the negative effects of non-standard grammar. The findings suggest that current AI tools are not yet equipped to fairly process the full range of human linguistic variation, from local English features to the stylistic patterns of human-centric writing. To support more inclusive use of AI in education, this study adapts the established concept of intelligibility into the idea of "digital intelligibility," and recommends improving training data and creating classroom space for open discussions about AI bias toward language diversity and stylistic choices.

AB  - This study aims to develop a comprehensive competency framework for artificial intelligence (AI) literacy, delineating essential competencies and sub-competencies. This framework and its potential variations, tailored to different learner groups (by educational level and discipline), can serve as a crucial reference for designing and implementing AI curricula. However, the research on AI literacy by target learners is still in its infancy, and the findings of several existing studies provide inconsistent guidelines for educational practices. Following the 2020 PRISMA guidelines, we searched the Web of Science, Scopus, and ScienceDirect databases to identify relevant studies published between January 2012 and October 2024. The quality of the included studies was evaluated using QualSyst. A total of 29 studies were identified, and their research findings were synthesized. Results show that at the K-12 level, the required competencies include basic AI knowledge, device usage, and AI ethics. For higher education, the focus shifts to understanding data and algorithms, problem-solving, and career-related competencies. For general workforce, emphasis is placed on the interpretation and utilization of data and AI tools for specific careers, along with error detection and AI-based decision-making. This study connects the progression of specific learning objectives, which should be intensively addressed at each stage, to propose an AI literacy education pathway. We discuss the findings, potentials, and limitations of the derived competency framework for AI literacy, including its theoretical and practical implications and future research suggestions.

AB  - This study investigates the role of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in music education, focusing on its dual function as a creative tool and a mechanism of algorithmic surveillance. Utilizing AI platforms such as Suno.AI, MusicFX, and Udio, the study examines AI's potential to foster creativity, enable synesthetic learning, and personalize music education while also raising ethical concerns about algorithmic bias, content moderation, and data-driven surveillance. Grounded in Michel Foucault's Panopticon and digital feminism, this research explores how AI tools reproduce gendered biases, shaping students' engagement with feminist discourse through censorship and content filtering. Findings suggest that while AI can enhance educational experiences, it also encourages self-censorship, moderates feminist texts disproportionately, and perpetuates digital gatekeeping. This paper calls for greater transparency in AI governance, algorithmic accountability, and feminist interventions in AI training datasets to ensure AI serves as an equitable and ethical tool in education. Future research should explore strategies for AI literacy in education, equipping students to critically engage with and resist algorithmic bias in digital learning environments.

AB  - In today's technology, there are rapid advances in the field of artificial intelligence. With the increasing involvement of artificial intelligence in daily activities, great changes are taking place in our habits. At this point, the necessity of educating students in accordance with the age of artificial intelligence emerges. Students' acquaintance with current technologies requires that the education provided is up to date. From these developments artificial intelligence, and its effects on society should be conveyed to students. The aim of the study is to implement the curriculum developed for middle school students to learn about the ethical dimension of artificial intelligence and to reveal students' views on the subject. Within the framework of the Artificial Intelligence and Ethics curriculum, 25 sixth grade students were trained. At the end of the training, a semistructured interview form was applied to the students. Students' views on the ethical dimension of artificial intelligence were revealed. As a result, education has been contributed with an artificial intelligence and ethics curriculum suitable for middle school students. In general, the approach of including the ethical dimension of artificial intelligence in education shows that middle school students can evaluate artificial intelligence as a personal and social issue beyond just having knowledge about its functioning.

AB  - There is a growing need to upskill higher education (HE) teachers for the effective and responsible integration of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in their classrooms. This case study sought to address this growing need by designing and delivering a training course for educators, focusing on the use of ChatGPT as it was the most commonly used tool at the time. The professional development opportunity lasted 5 weeks and covered critical aspects of GenAI use for teaching and learning. Data collected from participants included discussion board entries, written tasks and focus groups. Findings highlight some of the common practices and concerns HE practitioners had regarding the use of GenAI in their practice. The findings also emphasise the importance of providing teachers with customised GenAI training to facilitate its effective integration in HE contexts. Finally, based on the findings of this study, we propose the TPTP Support System for Teachers, built upon four key areas: teacher training, pedagogical support, testing revamp and practice networks. This system aims to guide institutional efforts to facilitate and support educators as they integrate GenAI in HE.

AB  - The integration of AI into TPACK frameworks is crucial for enhancing teacher readiness in an increasingly technology-driven educational environment. However, a significant gap exists in literature regarding assessing preservice teachers' knowledge on the integration of AI into their pedagogical practices based on the TPACK framework. This study investigates TPACK and AI-TPACK skills among English preservice teachers, addressing a significant gap in understanding their readiness to utilize AI tools in education. Employing a quantitative cross-sectional survey approach with structural equation modeling, the research examined 304 ELT preservice teachers. Findings reveal varying proficiency levels across TPACK and AI-TPACK components. In TPACK, participants demonstrated high competence in independent components like Technology Knowledge (TK) and Technological Pedagogical Knowledge (TPK), but lower abilities in integrated Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK). For AI-TPACK, preservice teachers exhibited above-average competence across all areas, with highest proficiency in Intelligent Technology Knowledge (AI-TK) and lowest in ethics. Gender and prior AI experience significantly influenced AI-TPACK skills. Strong positive correlations between traditional TPACK and AI-TPACK components were observed, suggesting simultaneous skill development is feasible. This study highlights the need for customized teacher training curricula that enhance integrated knowledge and ethical considerations of AI in teaching.

AB  - Background/purpose: Azerbaijani higher education is undergoing a rapid digital transformation in response to global advances in artificial intelligence (AI). Within this context, English language teaching (ELT) faces the challenge of integrating AI tools to enhance learning outcomes. However, little is known about how prepared educators and learners are for this shift. This study compares ELT faculty and student readiness for AI-integrated teaching and learning at a public Azerbaijani university, identifying gaps and capacity-building needs. Materials/methods: A convergent mixed-methods design was employed. Quantitatively, a survey measured technological and mindset readiness among 150 bachelor-level ELT students and 16 ELT faculty members. Qualitatively, two focus group interviews explored perceptions, perceived benefits, and concerns regarding AI in education. Results: Survey findings indicate that students reported higher technology familiarity and more positive attitudes toward AI compared to faculty, who demonstrated cautious optimism but lower self-assessed AI skills. Focus groups revealed that both groups recognised potential benefits, such as personalised learning support, while also expressing concerns about ethical use, data privacy, and insufficient training opportunities. Conclusion: A readiness gap exists: students appear more comfortable adopting AI, whereas faculty require targeted support to integrate AI pedagogically. To bridge this gap, institutions should prioritise professional development, establish clear guidelines, and implement supportive policies for AI adoption in ELT.

AB  - Intelligent Voice Assistants (IVAs) have become integral to many users' daily lives, using advanced algorithms to automate various tasks. Nevertheless, many users do not understand the underlying algorithms and how they work, posing potential risks to the competent and self-determined use of IVAs. This work develops three online training modules to promote algorithm awareness, providing (1) basic knowledge of algorithms, (2) risks posed by algorithms in IVAs, and (3) scientific evidence on algorithm aversion. A total of 110 participants were studied to analyze the training effects on various perception levels relevant to IVAs, including usage perception (attitude, exploration), privacy aspects (trustworthiness, privacy control), persuasion aspects (persuasion knowledge, anthropomorphic perception), and self-determined interaction variables (reflection, indulgence). The results show that the modules increase awareness of IVA algorithms, influence user perceptions (e.g., higher exploration intentions), and promote critical engagement with IVAs (e.g., lower trustworthiness). Moreover, the modules contribute to a higher sense of privacy control, reduce persuasive perceptions of IVAs (e.g., anthropomorphic perception), and promote self-determined interaction (e.g., higher indulgent use). The modules offer a new approach to promoting the competent use of IVAs in society and provide a starting point for further research and educational institutions to increase algorithm awareness for IVAs and other AI-based systems.

AB  - With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence, AI-powered learning platforms have become essential tools for college students to acquire knowledge and enhance their academic performance. However, students' readiness to effectively integrate AI into distance learning remains critical in maximizing its benefits. This study aimed to (1) examine students' readiness to apply artificial intelligence (AI) for distance learning in higher education and (2) compare the readiness levels between undergraduate and graduate students in distance education at Sukhothai Thammathirat Open University. The sample consisted of 445 students from 12 disciplines, including undergraduate and graduate students, selected through volunteer sampling. The research instrument was a survey assessing students' readiness to apply AI in distance learning at the tertiary level. Data analysis included frequency, percentage, mean, standard deviation, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and content analysis. The results revealed that (1) students demonstrated high readiness to use artificial intelligence for distance learning. The findings were as follows: 1.1) Of the respondents, 61.1% were female, and 38.9% were male. Undergraduates accounted for 59.8%, while 40.2% were graduate students, with most respondents in their second year (40.4%). Most (59.8%) had previous experience using AI for educational purposes, with popular platforms being ChatGPT, Gemini, Canva AI, and Claude. 1.2) Students demonstrated a high level of readiness to use artificial intelligence for distance learning (M = 3.78, S.D. = 1.08), 1.3) Students' understanding of artificial intelligence was moderate (M = 3.18, S.D. = 1.12), 1.4) Students' application of AI for distance learning was moderate (M = 3.20, S.D. = 1.18) and 1.5) the ethical and legal use of artificial intelligence for learning at a high level (M = 3.56, S.D. = 1.15). (2) No significant difference was found in the readiness levels between undergraduate and graduate students in using artificial intelligence for distance education (p > 0.05). Students recommended organizing additional courses or training sessions on using artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance their knowledge, practical skills, and awareness of necessary precautions when using AI. Key focus areas include preventing misuse, upholding ethical standards in AI applications, and ensuring data security.

AB  - The integration of generative AI tools in higher education presents both significant opportunities and challenges. This paper addresses two key questions: how AI should be incorporated into higher education and what ethical and pedagogical principles should guide its use. While AI enhances creativity, efficiency, and personalized learning, it also raises concerns about over-reliance, bias, and ethical implications. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature, this study examines the ethical and pedagogical impact of AI in education. Findings suggest that institutions must ensure AI complements traditional learning, uphold academic integrity, and promote critical thinking. Human-AI collaboration and equitable access are essential to support diverse learners. Additionally, prioritizing ethical AI use, data privacy, and AI literacy safeguards student rights and prepares educators and students for the evolving technological landscape. The paper concludes that institutions must develop clear AI policies, embed AI ethics into curricula, and provide ongoing faculty training. By addressing these considerations, higher education can harness AI's benefits while maintaining the critical role of human educators and ensuring equitable and ethical access for all learners.

AB  - A Professional Learning Community (PLC) invites learning by doing and that process is optimized through intentional, caring, optimistic, respectful, and trustworthy (I-CORT) mindsets (Purkey & Novak, 2015; Anderson, 2021), which fosters a positive and supportive learning environment. A school having a PLC focusing on generative artificial intelligence (AI) policy development and best-practice curriculum integration can identify where additional support or training is needed. Generative AI-driven educational software is going to become more, not less, pervasive. So, educators need to be highly trained in effective implementation of evolving teaching and learning applications. Therefore, effective pedagogy involves more than telling a student to access an application. Teacher preparation programs and institutional policies should lead these professional development endeavors. Several suggestions, approaches, and models are provided herein to promote best practices that align Invitational Education (IE) theory, with utilization of AI.

AB  - This study examines how secondary-school students recognize and relate to artificial intelligence (AI) and the meanings they attribute to it in their everyday lives. Using a quantitative, descriptive, cross-sectional design, we explore the subjectivities of a purposive sample of 576 students from both public and private schools. The analysis focuses on students' use of AI across seven dimensions: teaching-learning, ethics and morality, emotions, personal development, cognition and creativity, social construction, and recreation and entertainment. Data were collected with an ad hoc instrument that showed high internal consistency ([alpha] = 0.89). The findings reveal a variety of positions, including emotional ambivalence, ethical uncertainty, autonomous learning, and diverse perceptions of the creative, social, and educational effects of AI. Although students express openness and interest in technology, they also voice doubts about its integration into school practices and its influence on critical thinking and personal initiative. The results underscore the need for educational policies and school practices aligned with Education 5.0 that foster critical, ethical, and humanistic uses of technology. This research contributes to understanding the configuration of digital youth subjectivities and provides a broad framework for designing meaningful, contextualized, and inclusive pedagogical strategies that develop digital citizenship.

AB  - Although artificial Intelligence (AI) is prevalent and impacts facets of daily life, there is limited research on responsible and humanistic design, implementation, and evaluation of AI, especially in the field of education. Afterall, learning is inherently a social endeavor involving human interactions, rendering the need for AI designs to be approached from a humanistic perspective, or human-centered AI (HAI). This study focuses on the use of essays as a principal means for assessing learning outcomes, through students' writing in subjects that require arguments and justifications, such as ethics and moral reasoning. We considered AI with a human and student-centric design for formative assessment, using an automated essay scoring (AES) and feedback system to address issues of running an online course with large enrolment and to provide efficient feedback to students with substantial time savings for the instructor. The development of the AES system occurred over four phases as part of an iterative design cycle. A mixed-method approach was used, allowing instructors to qualitatively code subsets of data for training a machine learning model based on the Random Forest algorithm. This model was subsequently used to automatically score more essays at scale. Findings show substantial agreement on inter-rater reliability before model training was conducted with acceptable training accuracy. The AES system's performance was slightly less accurate than human raters but is improvable over multiple iterations of the iterative design cycle. This system has allowed instructors to provide formative feedback, which was not possible in previous runs of the course.

AB  - The rapid rise of AI use is creating some very serious legal and ethical issues such as bias, discrimination, inequity, privacy violations, and--as creators everywhere fear--theft of protected intellectual property. Because AI platforms "learn" by scraping training materials available online or what is provided to them through their human programmers, these systems can easily capture copyrighted expressions, such as song lyrics, computer code, stories, or images, and use them to generate new works without attribution. This rise in AI use of protected material is spawning an array of legal actions as artists, programmers, writers, photographers and other creative individuals witness the erosion of their value in the marketplace and the world. As students prepare to enter the field, they need to be aware of legal issues and concerns that they may face and methods for addressing them. This case focuses on the problem of AI copyright infringement of art and includes an exploratory exercise that introduces students to the act of "scraping"--a primary AI training method by which copyrighted works may be vulnerable to potential infringement.

AB  - Background: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has raised significant ethical concerns, prompting higher education institutions to reconsider how they prepare future STEM professionals to navigate such concerns responsibly. Despite growing efforts to integrate AI ethics into higher education, a lack of consensus and standardized approaches has led to inconsistent ethics education and disparities in graduates' preparedness for ethical issues related to AI. This study examined the role of higher education institutions in fostering ethical awareness in AI, focusing on institutional responsibilities and strategies as perceived by 95 science and engineering graduate students. Participants engaged in a case-based AI ethics activity, and their responses to open-ended questions were analyzed using inductive content analysis. Results: The analysis identified three key themes regarding students' views on institutional responsibility about AI and ethics. Most students indicated the essential responsibility of universities, citing their social, professional, educational, and reputational obligations. Others advocated for a shared responsibility, emphasizing the importance of collaboration between academia, industry, and society. A smaller group endorsed a constrained view of responsibility, questioning the feasibility and relevance of AI ethics education within academic settings. Students proposed various strategies for fostering ethical awareness, with standalone ethics courses being the most frequently discussed. Additional recommendations included interactive learning approaches, embedding ethics into curricula, and strengthening institutional leadership. Conclusions: This study underscores the central role of higher education institutions in fostering ethical awareness in AI for science and engineering graduates, with most students emphasizing universities' societal and professional responsibilities. It highlights the need to align ethics education with technical training and professional trajectories in STEM subjects, offering actionable insights for higher education institutions to better prepare graduates for the ethical complexities of AI use and development.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is bringing new developments in education. Teachers' professional development grows with the promotion of technology, and more challenges and difficulties will be faced by teachers in the AI age. Thus, this study aimed to explore what a teacher portrait should be like in the new AI age. In order to systematically and comprehensively construct a teacher portrait for the AI age, we searched online databases using keywords, and after screening according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 26 journal documents were identified for in-depth analysis. It was found that there were 20 different types of frameworks that could be used to construct a teacher portrait for the AI age. This study reconstructed a teacher portrait based on the Person-Process-Content (PPC) structure of the micro ecological system theory, and finally arrived at a teacher portrait framework with three dimensions and eight sub-dimensions, including teachers' cognition and emotion, teachers' knowledge and skills, and interaction between teachers' cognition and ability, which highlighted the dynamic requirements of teachers' professional development in the AI age. In addition, the challenges faced by teachers in the AI age are mainly concentrated on four aspects: the upgrading of teacher training requirements, the change of educational environment, the teaching application of digital technology, and the ethical issues of artificial intelligence. These findings provide a direction for promoting the professional development of teachers in the AI age, and can help teachers better cope with the challenges of the new age.

AB  - This study aims to examine high school students' artificial intelligence literacy in visual arts subjects and their attitudes toward metaverse-based digital art. The research was conducted using a comparative-relational screening model, one of the screening models. The study sample consisted of 278 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th grade students. The Visual Themed Artificial Intelligence Literacy Scale and the Metaverse-Based Digital Art Scale were used as data collection tools. According to the research findings, high school students' AI literacy levels in visual subjects were found to be moderate, while their metaverse-based digital art attitudes were found to be low. Analyses conducted by gender revealed that male students had significantly higher mean scores than female students in both AI literacy and metaverse-based digital art attitudes. Comparisons by grade level revealed that 12th grade students had significantly higher AI literacy levels in visual subjects and metaverse-based digital art attitudes than 9th grade students. Regression analysis revealed that AI literacy in visual subjects significantly and positively predicted metaverse-based digital art attitudes, with the model explaining 19.3% of the variance. Based on the research findings, the following recommendations are recommended: developing AI literacy at an early age, integrating the metaverse into visual arts, providing digital pedagogical training for teachers, and enhancing school environments with augmented reality support. Digital ethics should be emphasized in curricula, the STEAM approach should be supported, and intercultural communication should be encouraged through metaverse-based digital art exhibitions. Future research should examine the multidimensional nature of artificial intelligence literacy, and changes in metaverse attitudes should be assessed through longitudinal and experimental studies.

AB  - In this study, we delve into the opportunities, challenges and prospects of gifted students in middle and secondary school in tapping artificial intelligence (AI). The first part introduces AI and its role in education and discusses how school students need to understand and use AI effectively. The second part examines the concept of giftedness and the characteristics of gifted students. The research employs a mixed-methods approach, administering questionnaires to two groups: It provides gifted students and peers with average IQs. Results show that gifted students often use AI tools (ChatGPT primarily) as tools to advance their learning and to self-explore, whereas, for non-gifted students (average IQ), AI is predominantly used for completing their homework. While all groups can see the value of AI in increasing engagement and motivation, they all also struggle with difficulties, like technical problems and privacy problems. The implications are that personalized feedback and effective inclusion of AI tools within an educational curriculum are both critical. The findings conclude that AI tools should be integrated into school curricula to boost students' ability in personalizing learning, boost learning by means of creativity, and augment technological competence of students. For AI to be effectively integrated, professional development of educators becomes very important. Finally, the study supports for learning environment, which is both collaborative and innovative and uses AI to support students' diverse needs.

AB  - Within the context of Saudi Arabia's digital transformation strategy, "Vision 2030", the issue of artificial intelligence (AI) adoption in higher education is gaining momentum, changing the form of the formative assessment procedure and its perception. Given the scope of interests in the functions of Arabic Natural Language Processing (NLP) feedback, this study examines the impact of AI-based formative assessment on instructors' flexibility, writing scores, and student engagement in Saudi Arabian institutions. Ten undergraduate students and five faculty members from public and private institutions were invited to participate in the research, which employed a mixed-methods approach to reconstruct classroom settings. Although the qualitative data, gathered through responses in the form of stories, were analyzed using the theme-square approach to identify linguistic and cultural orientations in the interpretation of feedback, the quantitative data, such as revision rates, engagement, and performance ratings, were analyzed using descriptive statistical methods. Although concerns about forcing speakers to use Arabic language technology as a natural language do exist, which are relevant to cultural, linguistic, and fairness issues, the results suggest limited and gradual improvement in the quality and quantity of revisions, resulting in students writing with the assistance of AI-generated feedback. The results offer insight into why culturally specific AI systems are crucial for fostering an equitable culture, delivering practical instruction, and supporting the professional development of faculty members. The current study significantly impacts the ongoing debate about artificial intelligence in education and its consequences for educational settings, especially in non-English-speaking contexts.

AB  - The use of predictive analytics powered by machine learning (ML) to model educational data has increasingly been identified to exhibit bias towards marginalized populations, prompting the need for more equitable applications of these techniques. To tackle bias that emerges in training data or models at different stages of the ML modelling pipeline, numerous debiasing approaches have been proposed. Yet, research into state-of-the-art techniques for effectively employing these approaches to enhance fairness in educational predictive scenarios remains limited. Prior studies often focused on mitigating bias from a single source at a specific stage of model construction within narrowly defined scenarios, overlooking the complexities of bias originating from multiple sources across various stages. Moreover, these approaches were often evaluated using typical threshold-dependent fairness metrics, which fail to account for real-world educational scenarios where thresholds are typically unknown before evaluation. To bridge these gaps, this study systematically examined a total of 28 representative debiasing approaches, categorized by the sources of bias and the stage they targeted, for two critical educational predictive tasks, namely forum post classification and student career prediction. Both tasks involve a two-phase modelling process where features learned from upstream models in the first phase are fed into classical ML models for final predictions, which is a common yet under-explored setting for educational data modelling. The study observed that addressing local stereotypical bias, label bias or proxy discrimination in training data, as well as imposing fairness constraints on models, can effectively enhance predictive fairness. But their efficacy was often compromised when features from upstream models were inherently biased. Beyond that, this study proposes two novel strategies, namely Multi-Stage and Multi-Source debiasing to integrate existing approaches. These strategies demonstrated substantial improvements in mitigating unfairness, underscoring the importance of unified approaches capable of addressing biases from various sources across multiple stages.

AB  - This paper presents a comprehensive framework for AI-enhanced curriculum development in rare earth elements (REE) education, addressing critical workforce gaps across K-12, higher education, and veteran transition programs. As global demand for critical minerals escalates amid geopolitical tensions and supply chain vulnerabilities, we propose an integrated educational approach that bridges artificial intelligence with traditional geosciences. Our research analyzes current initiatives, identifies curriculum gaps, and develops scalable AI-enhanced learning models that combine theoretical knowledge with practical applications. The framework encompasses personalized learning systems, virtual reality simulations, and adaptive assessment tools to prepare diverse learner populations for careers in the critical minerals sector. We introduce multiple architectures including an integrated AI platform for the REE value chain, multi-agent systems for mineral exploration, circular economy models for sustainability, and supply chain resilience frameworks. Quantitative analysis demonstrates significant improvements in exploration efficiency, materials discovery timelines, and educational outcomes through AI implementation. The paper also addresses implementation challenges, ethical considerations, and provides strategic recommendations for policy support and investment. This educational framework supports national security objectives while creating sustainable career pathways in an increasingly vital industry, ultimately contributing to domestic workforce development and supply chain resilience in the critical minerals sector.

AB  - Generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI) has emerged as a transformative tool in higher education, widely adopted by both students and faculty for tasks ranging from writing to coding. Despite its growing usage, concerns over academic integrity and its long-term impact on learning persist. While educational institutions are developing policies to guide responsible Gen AI use, these measures often fail to prepare students for the realities of workplace applications. This qualitative study explores the gap between academic and professional usage of Gen AI through structured interviews with two groups: 20 faculty members and 20 industry professionals. Descriptive analysis of the data revealed a significant disconnect between pedagogical and industry practices, potentially leaving students underprepared for workplace demands. Faculty noted Gen AI's ability to assist in course-specific assignments but expressed concerns about over-reliance and ethical implications. Industry professionals emphasized its role in increasing efficiency through technical documentation, data processing, and decision-making, while identifying challenges like data security and ethical use. To address these issues, the study recommends a systemic approach that integrates hands-on Gen AI training, ethical instruction, and industry-aligned curricula into higher education. This approach includes embedding AI education into general education requirements and faculty development programs to ensure comprehensive preparedness. Additionally, collaborative projects, internships, and strategic partnerships with industry and accrediting bodies are essential to aligning curricula with workforce demands. Together, these efforts can equip students with the technical skills and ethical awareness needed to navigate and contribute effectively to AI-driven workplaces.

AB  - As of 2021, more than 30 countries have released national artificial intelligence (AI) policy strategies. These documents articulate plans and expectations regarding how AI will impact policy sectors, including education, and typically discuss the social and ethical implications of AI. This article engages in thematic analysis of 24 such national AI policy strategies, reviewing the role of education in global AI policy discourse. It finds that the use of AI in education (AIED) is largely absent from policy conversations, while the instrumental value of education in supporting an AI-ready workforce and training more AI experts is overwhelmingly prioritized. Further, the ethical implications of AIED receive scant attention despite the prominence of AI ethics discussion generally in these documents. This suggests that AIED and its broader policy and ethical implications--good or bad--have failed to reach mainstream awareness and the agendas of key decision-makers, a concern given that effective policy and careful consideration of ethics are inextricably linked, as this article argues. In light of these findings, the article applies a framework of five AI ethics principles to consider ways in which policymakers can better incorporate AIED's implications. Finally, the article offers recommendations for AIED scholars on strategies for engagement with the policymaking process, and for performing ethics and policy-oriented AIED research to that end, in order to shape policy deliberations on behalf of the public good.

AB  - This paper explores the impact of digital technologies and artificial intelligence on higher education from the perspective of students at four Armenian universities. Data from in-depth interviews with 200 students and focus group discussions highlight how digital platforms and AI tools are used for academic purposes, assess student satisfaction, and identify challenges. Findings show that 83.5% of students believe their academic performance improved through digital and AI tools, with platforms like ChatGPT widely adopted. Despite this, gaps persist, including limited digital skills training and insufficient AI integration at universities. Most students predict a significant impact of AI on education in the next five years but do not want AI to replace human teachers. The study reveals significant associations between digital tool usage frequency, AI's influence on academic performance, and students' likelihood to recommend these tools. Students appreciate the benefits of increased accessibility and personalised learning but raise concerns about technical issues, data privacy, and reduced human interaction. The study highlights the need for further integration of AI-driven tools such as AI-assisted teaching, chatbots for 24/7 support, virtual labs, augmented reality tools, and AI-based mental health monitoring. These insights can guide universities in enhancing education through digital and AI technologies.

AB  - The rising demand for high-quality, timely content for online and blended learning environments presents significant challenges for instructional designers, particularly in managing resource-intensive tasks such as video production and image sourcing. This study investigates the impact of using artificial intelligence (AI), specifically large language models (LLMs), on key evaluation criteria for self-organized, online, and blended learning modules. Using the case of 'aprendo. ch,' a professional development platform provided free of charge to teachers in the canton of St. Gallen that has recently implemented AI-enhanced workflows, we analyze how AI-enhanced content affects module evaluation outcomes, including perceived learning quality, learner satisfaction, and instructional design efficiency. Statistical analyses indicate significant differences between AI-enhanced and traditional modules, with AI-enhanced modules receiving higher evaluations in module structure, competency development, and learner recommendation. Furthermore, we discuss ethical considerations, such as data bias and content accuracy, and provide practical recommendations for the responsible integration of AI in educational design to balance efficiency with educational quality.

AB  - Throughout history, artificial intelligence (AI) has impacted various aspects of human life and professional industries, including the field of education, by mimicking human behaviors and tasks to increase productivity and efficiency (Grudin et al., 2023; Haenlein & Kaplan, 2019). Generative AI is a form of AI using deep learning to quickly generate text, images, music, and endless types of content based on datasets training it. The training data is gathered from a corpus of information on the internet (Javaid et al., 2023; Ngo, 2023; Rahman & Watanobe, 2023). In 2022, generative AI became accessible to individuals of all ages and backgrounds when the company OpenAI launched ChatGPT works (Javaid et al., 2023; Ngo, 2023; Rahman & Watanobe, 2023). Educators began to use generative AI to plan instruction, create materials, and complete daily tasks more efficiently (Alabool, 2023; Fisk, 2023; Rahman & Watanobe, 2023). Students began to use generative AI to assist with schoolwork, studying, proofreading, and creating content for school (Hosseini et al., 2023; Ray, 2023b). Concerns about quality, accuracy, bias, academic integrity, and data security surfaced among educators as the use of generative AI increased (Abramski et al., 2023; Eke, 2023; Perkins, 2023; Ray, 2023b; Su & Yang, 2023). As educators navigated the opportunities and pitfalls of generative AI in teaching and learning, a need to understand educators' perspectives of the phenomenon became necessary. This study, therefore, holds significant value in providing insight into the experiences and perceptions of secondary teachers on using generative AI as a tool for teaching and learning. This qualitative, phenomenological study explored the perceptions of secondary teachers on using generative AI as a tool for teaching and learning. The researcher conducted semi-structured interviews with ten teachers of core subjects (science, social studies, and English language arts) in grades 9-12 from western Pennsylvania schools, seeking insight into experiences with and perceptions of generative AI in schools focused on five research questions: (a) How do teachers of students in grades 9-12 core content courses see generative AI being used in schools in Western Pennsylvania? (b) What do core content teachers of students in grades 9-12 believe are the benefits of using generative AI in the teaching and learning process? (c) What concerns do core content teachers of students in grades 9-12 have regarding using generative AI in schools? (d) How do core content teachers of students in grades 9-12 perceive the level of preparation and guidance from school leaders on the use of generative AI in their school? (e) How do teachers perceive the impact of generative AI on students? The key findings noted teachers used generative AI to create comprehensive materials and communicate with stakeholders. Additionally, the findings indicated teachers are concerned about academic integrity, the quality of AI output, and the need generative AI presented to change classroom instructional practices. The key findings also revealed teachers need more targeted professional development on generative AI related to teaching and learning along with guidance from administration and policy and procedures for generative AI usage. The final key findings expressed concerns about students using generative AI to minimize effort while reducing the authenticity of learning experiences. These finding are supported by existing research. Additionally, the key findings support the notion that generative AI can support effective instruction when teachers are presented with targeted professional development, policies, and procedures and develop strategies that involve teaching effective methods to check the accuracy of AI output along with tools to detect academic integrity issues partnered with quality instruction about the importance of academic integrity.

AB  - Due to the rapid emergence and use of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) by English as a foreign language (EFL) students in higher education (HE), further research is required to understand English language teaching (ELT) teachers' training needs to effectively manage digitally enhanced teaching and learning. This study identifies teachers' needs by investigating Turkish ELT teachers' reactions to their students' self-reported GenAI usage. Our transcendental phenomenological research design ensured minimal author bias from the thematically analysed, qualitative, interview data from 21 Turkish undergraduate EFL students (B1-C1 level) and six Turkish ELT teachers. Analysis has revealed that students used ChatGPT (version 3.5) as a human collaborator to build content, clarify tasks, be a critical friend, organise ideas, enhance language, and obtain feedback, which they found motivating. However, teachers' reactions to their students' usage were inconsistent and exposed a need for unified teacher identity development that is shaped by GenAI literacy training and supported by institutional policies that address GenAI integration into curriculum design and assessment practices.

AB  - The integration of conversational artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots into English as a Foreign Language (EFL) education represents a transformative technological advancement with significant potential for enhancing both student learning outcomes and teacher professional development. This comprehensive review examines how AI chatbots can be effectively utilized to develop linguistic competencies across speaking, listening, reading, and writing skills while supporting EFL teachers' professional growth. Drawing from recent empirical research and theoretical frameworks, this article provides evidence-based guidance for educators, administrators, and researchers seeking to implement chatbot technology in language education contexts. The analysis reveals that AI chatbots, particularly advanced systems like ChatGPT, can provide personalised learning experiences, immediate feedback, and scalable educational support that addresses traditional challenges in EFL instruction. Key findings indicate significant improvements in learners' speaking fluency, writing proficiency, and willingness to communicate when chatbots are integrated thoughtfully into pedagogical practices. For teachers, AI chatbots serve as valuable tools for content creation, assessment development, and instructional strategy enhancement, while also supporting their own language proficiency development. However, successful implementation requires careful attention to pedagogical integration, ethical considerations, and maintaining balanced human-AI interaction. This article presents a comprehensive framework for chatbot integration that encompasses theoretical foundations, practical implementation strategies, specific functional applications, and professional development approaches. The evidence suggests that when properly implemented with appropriate teacher training and pedagogical support, Conversational AI chatbots can significantly enhance EFL education quality and accessibility while preparing both teachers and students for increasingly AI-integrated educational futures.

AB  - The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in education offers transformative opportunities for personalized learning and efficient instructional practices. However, the successful adoption of AI in classrooms is contingent upon teachers' preparedness, technological literacy, and understanding of ethical considerations. This study examined how these factors alongside professional development and access to technology influence the effective implementation of AI tools in classrooms. A quantitative research design involved 210 teachers from nine schools in Punjab, Pakistan, was employed, utilizing structured questionnaires to collect data on these variables. The findings revealed significant positive correlations between technological literacy, professional development, and access to technology with the effective use of AI tools. Ethical considerations, while moderately correlated, showed lower statistical significance, underscoring the need for more focus in this area. Access to technology emerged as the strongest predictor of successful AI implementation, highlighting disparities in infrastructure as a critical barrier, particularly in under resourced schools. The study underscores the necessity of holistic strategies to empower educators through targeted training, ethical literacy, and equitable resource allocation. By addressing these factors, schools can unlock AI's potential to enhance teaching and learning while promoting inclusivity and innovation in education. The findings provide actionable recommendations for policymakers and educators to bridge gaps in preparedness and equity.

AB  - The increasing demand for privacy-preserving, ethically aligned synthetic data generation in education has highlighted the limitations of existing tabular data generators. Traditional approaches often sacrifice fairness or privacy in pursuit of predictive accuracy, rendering them unsuitable for high-stakes academic settings. In this paper, we propose FairSYN-Edu, a novel diffusion-based synthetic data generation framework designed for educational data. By integrating adversarial debiasing and differentially private training into the generative process, FairSYN-Edu jointly optimizes utility, fairness, and privacy. We evaluate our approach on three real-world educational datasets spanning MOOC, K-12 tutoring, and LMS environments. Experimental results demonstrate that FairSYN-Edu achieves significantly lower demographic disparities, maintains competitive predictive performance (RMSE = 0.402), and provides moderate resistance to membership inference attacks (AUC = 0.705). Ablation studies, error gap analysis, and SHAP-based interpretability evaluations confirm the robustness and ethical reliability of our method. We release the complete implementation, synthetic benchmark suite, and documentation to promote reproducibility and responsible AI practices in education.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has been integrated into higher education (HE), offering numerous benefits and transforming teaching and learning. Since its launch, ChatGPT has become the most popular learning model among Generation Z college students in HE. This study aimed to assess the knowledge, concerns, attitudes, and ethics of using ChatGPT among Generation Z college students in HE in Peru. An online survey was administered to 201 HE students with prior experience using the ChatGPT for academic activities. Two of the six proposed hypotheses were confirmed: Perceived Ethics (B = 0.856) and Student Concerns (B = 0.802). The findings suggest that HE students' knowledge and positive attitudes toward ChatGPT do not guarantee its effective adoption and use. It is important to investigate how attitudes of optimism, skepticism, or apathy toward AI develop and how these attitudes influence the intention to use technologies such as the ChatGPT in HE settings. The dependence on ChatGPT raises ethical concerns that must be addressed with responsible use programs in HE. No sex or age differences were found in the relationship between the use of ChatGPTs and perceived ethics among HE students. However, further studies with diverse HE samples are needed to determine this relationship. To promote the ethical use of the ChatGPT in HE, institutions must develop comprehensive training programs, guidelines, and policies that address issues such as academic integrity, privacy, and misinformation. These initiatives should aim to educate students and university teachers on the responsible use of ChatGPT and other AI-based tools, fostering a culture of ethical adoption of AI to leverage its benefits and mitigate its potential risks, such as a lack of academic integrity.

AB  - The proliferation of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) technologies has significantly impacted the educational sector, prompting a re-evaluation of teaching, learning, and assessment practices. This study explores the perceptions of Ontario secondary school teachers regarding the challenges and opportunities presented by GenAI. Using a qualitative research method, 17 high school teachers were interviewed to understand their views on GenAI integration and its implications for academic integrity. The findings reveal three critical areas for integrating GenAI in education: "generating people" through professional development and ethical training for educators, "generating programs" by designing transparent and purpose-driven initiatives, and "generating policies" through the creation of clear, adaptable governance frameworks. Together, these pillars highlight the collaborative work needed to harness GenAI's potential while ensuring ethical and equitable practices in secondary education. These themes are a subset of invitational education and highlight the need for comprehensive training for teachers, the development of transparent guidelines and ethical practices, and the establishment of robust policies to support the integration of GenAI in education. The study emphasizes the importance of collaboration among educators, administrators, and other stakeholders to effectively navigate the evolving landscape of GenAI-driven educational environments effectively. By addressing these pillars, academic institutions can harness the transformative potential of GenAI while maintaining the integrity and quality of education. This research provides valuable insights into the evolving role of teachers and the necessity for strategic planning, professional development, and policy frameworks to optimize the benefits of GenAI in secondary education.

AB  - This paper presents the best practices used by institutional review boards (IRBs) and human research protections programs (HRPPs) to prepare online graduate student investigators for human research protections specific to research within online graduate degree programs or where research supervisors are not proximal to graduate student investigators and their research protocols. In recent years, advances in artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and other data mining/scraping forms have adversely impacted individual privacy and the unintended sharing of personally identifiable information (PII). With this growth of ubiquitous digital technologies, such as AI, ML, and data mining/scraping, used across online graduate degree programs, specialized training and preparation are needed to best prepare graduate student researchers for human research protections involving data with PII. Implications for IRBs and HRPPs are also addressed in this rapidly evolving climate, with recommendations for the design of online graduate degree programs that include graduate research and the best strategies to prepare online graduate student investigators for human research protections.

AB  - Continuing professional development plays a pivotal role in creating opportunities for teachers to explore the evolving educational landscape. With the integration of Artificial Intelligence into education, these opportunities involve grasping teachers' attitudes, expectations, and pedagogical approaches, with a focus on ethical considerations. Nevertheless, existing research and professional learning opportunities often overlook the perspectives of educators on these themes. Aiming to bridge this gap, this Educational Design Research approach began with a systematic literature review, followed by a Delphi study to gather educational stakeholders' insights on the ethical concerns of using AI in education. The current study presents the research third phase. It explores findings from focus groups with educators responsible for K-12 teacher education, informing the design of a training programme that addresses ethical concerns and agency. Four groups were conducted using a semi-structured script, centred on pre-provided scenarios. Data analysis involved thematic coding using both deductive and inductive approaches, revealing key themes related to: employing AI applications in course delivery for a mindful, hands-on exploration; discussing ethical and policy frameworks with a focus on contextual needs and "technogeographies"; addressing uncertainty, resistance, and transition; and fostering individual and collective agency regarding ethical issues through informal learning channels to build a nuanced narrative that challenges the corporate one. The study concludes by highlighting the importance of greater investment in professional development to enable educators to critically assess and reshape the values associated with education in the context of Artificial Intelligence, thereby contributing to the movement of aligning AI with our humanity.

AB  - This paper provides a thorough examination of the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly ChatGPT and other AI language models, in the realm of education. Drawing insights from existing literature and a novel study on educator perspectives, the paper delves into the potential advantages, ethical dilemmas, and factors shaping educators' attitudes towards AI integration in education. AI language models have the potential to revolutionize educational content creation, personalize learning experiences, and streamline assessment and feedback processes. These capabilities hold the potential to enhance teaching and learning outcomes while catering to the diverse needs of students. However, ethical concerns loom large in the adoption of AI in education. Bias in generated content is a chief concern, as it can perpetuate societal biases and lead to unfair treatment or the dissemination of inaccurate information. The solution lies in rigorous data curation to ensure equitable educational experiences for all students. Moreover, the potential for generating inappropriate or misleading content poses a significant ethical challenge, impacting students' well-being, civic understanding, and social interactions. Safeguards must be implemented to detect and rectify biased or inappropriate content, fostering inclusive and unbiased learning environments. Transparency emerges as a crucial ethical consideration. The opacity of AI models like ChatGPT makes it difficult to comprehend their decision-making processes. Enhancing model interpretability and explainability is vital for accountability and addressing embedded ethical issues. Privacy concerns related to data collection and usage are emphasized in the literature. Clear policies and guidelines must govern data collection, use, and protection, ensuring data is solely employed for educational purposes and maintaining robust data security measures. Our study expands upon these insights by exploring socio-demographic factors, motivations, and social influences affecting educators' AI adoption in higher education. These findings inform institutions on tailoring AI integration strategies, emphasizing responsible usage through training, and assessing the impact on learning outcomes. As educational institutions increasingly embrace AI, including advanced models like GPT-4, a cautious and thoughtful approach is vital. Balancing potential benefits with ethical challenges ensures that AI enhances teaching and learning while upholding fairness, equity, and accountability. In summary, this paper illuminates the potential of AI in education, accentuates ethical concerns, and highlights the significance of understanding educators' perspectives. Collaboration between educators and policymakers is essential to navigate the complexities of AI integration, ensuring that education remains a realm of equitable, efficient, and accountable learning experiences.

AB  - Background: Ethical decision-making is at the core of higher education, yet case-based ethics training often lacks depth and practical judgment. This study investigates whether integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Virtual Reality (VR) enhances ethical reasoning compared with conventional training. Sixty undergraduates in business and engineering were randomly assigned to a control group (traditional case-based role-play) or an experimental group (immersive training with Meta Quest 3 head-mounted displays using the VirtualSpeech platform). The research methodology was grounded on the Descriptive Decision Theory and Learning-Oriented Assessment (LOA) framework, emphasizing formative, feedback-rich learning aligned with Cognitive Load Theory, Experiential and Constructivist Learning, Dual-Process Theory, and AI-driven adaptive guidance. Results: Ethical competence was assessed pre- and post-intervention across seven dimensions: dilemma recognition, evaluation of alternatives, justification, consequence analysis, contextualization, application of principles, and stakeholder/social impact. Both groups improved significantly, but the AI/VR group showed consistently larger gains and improvement. Paired and Independent t-tests, with effect-size estimates (Cohen's d and Hedges' g), revealed large effects favoring immersive learning. The highest post-test advantages for the AI/VR group were observed in consequence analysis (t = -96.90, [delta] = 23.30, p < 0.001), evaluation of alternatives (t = -90.03, [delta] = 20.20, p < 0.001), and application of ethical principles (t = -80.57, [delta] = 20.83, p < 0.001). Minor within-group dispersion and sample homogeneity supported internal consistency and robustness of the outcomes under immersive conditions. Conclusions: Immersive, feedback-rich AI/VR training significantly outperformed traditional methods in strengthening ethical reasoning. The findings support integrating AI- and VR-based simulations into ethics curricula to enhance consequence analysis, principled reasoning, and stakeholder awareness. Future research should explore long-term effects, hybrid delivery, and broader applicability across disciplines and professional settings.

AB  - The rapid emergence of agentic artificial intelligence (AI) systems represents a paradigm shift in military operations, demanding fundamental transformation of US military education. This paper presents a comprehensive framework for reskilling and redesigning military education to address critical workforce readiness gaps in the era of autonomous AI systems. Utilizing a mixed-methods review of defense reports, case studies, and quantitative workforce data, this paper develops a comprehensive framework for reskilling the defense force to address critical readiness gaps in the era of autonomous AI. Through analysis of current AI adoption trends, quantitative workforce assessments, and educational limitations, we identify that only 10-15% of military personnel feel adequately trained for agentic AI integration despite significant investments exceeding $600-900 million in next-generation AI capabilities. Our proposed solution features a multi-tiered educational architecture with progressive competency levels, a continuous curriculum development pipeline, and layered technology integration. The framework addresses identified skills gaps through foundational AI literacy for all personnel, operational competence for mid-career leaders, and strategic AI leadership development. Implementation strategies include phased rollout over 24-36 months, multi-stakeholder engagement models, and comprehensive assessment mechanisms. Findings demonstrate that successful agentic AI integration requires not only technical upskilling but also fundamental changes in pedagogical approaches, institutional culture, and resource allocation--with optimal distribution of 30-40% to technology infrastructure, 20-25% to faculty development, 15-20% to curriculum design, and program evaluation. This research provides actionable recommendations for military education institutions to prepare personnel for human-AI teaming, autonomous system oversight, and ethical AI application in complex operational environments. decrease medical as well as financial burden, hence improving the management of cirrhotic patients. These predictors, however, need further work to validate reliability. All results and proposals are from cited literature.

AB  - Background: Citation practices are fundamental to teaching scholarly writing. With the emergence of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, students need a structured way to cite when and how these technologies are used. Objective: This paper introduces an instructor resource, an AI Contribution Statement, which provides students with an ethical and explicit framework for reporting on AI use during idea generation and writing in research methods. Method: Students were guided to create an AI Contribution Statement that reports when an AI technology was used for a research paper, what prompts were given and text generated, and how the information was incorporated into a final written product. Results: Sixty-four percent of students reported using AI assistive technologies. Of those, 33.12% reported using it more than twice, suggesting that, when allowed in a course, students' use is relatively low. Conclusion: Training students in best citation practices regarding ethical and transparent use of AI technologies is important, yet additional research is needed to understand how students are using it and how instructors can leverage this tool to foster equity. Teaching Implications: An AI Contribution Statement is an important addition to research methods teaching to create equality in technology use and student success.

AB  - In the 1970s, research on artificial intelligence in education emerged with the aim of acknowledging and accommodating the psychological aspects of the learning process. Since then, its applications have evolved and it is now used for student learning and assessment, teachers' pedagogical practice, management of educational institutions, and lifelong learning. Nevertheless, the ethical challenges of educational programmes using these systems have not been thoroughly studied. Anchored on the theoretical frame of dialogic ethics, this paper presents a section of a participatory futures research project. The goal of the research is to develop a toolkit that educators can use to ensure a smooth and ethical transition to artificial intelligence-based education while preserving the interests of educational development. This paper emphasises the need for an informed and participatory process that involves all stakeholders and begins with an expert consultation through the Delphi method, the results of which allowed the construction of eight hypothetical futures scenarios. These scenarios provide evidence that examining the ethics of using artificial intelligence systems presents an opportunity to reflect on the ethics of education as a whole. They highlight the challenge of balancing the benefits and drawbacks of such systems, especially concerning educational goals and the interplay between diverse educational actors and personal development in educational settings. The study outcomes are intended to encourage discussions on the integration of ethical artificial intelligence in education and facilitate the continuing professional development of teachers by equipping them with scenarios that can be used as a resource for training purposes.

AB  - As the world is increasingly infused with artificial intelligence (AI), school teachers are beginning to acquire AI literacy and to integrate AI-related content into their teaching practices. However, research on teachers' AI competencies is still in its early stage, leaving many gaps yet to be explored. This study engaged 364 Chinese practicing teachers involved in teaching AI lessons after receiving training, employing a six-factor instrument. The survey assessed teachers' efficacies in understanding AI and teaching AI, with additional considerations of promoting ethical awareness and designing socially beneficial AI applications. In addition, teachers' continuous intention to learn AI and their attitudes toward teaching AI were measured. The survey underwent rigorous validation procedures, confirming its construct validity through confirmatory factor analysis, and demonstrating satisfactory reliabilities and convergent and discriminant validities through other statistical analyses. Structural equation modeling provided support for most of the hypotheses. Further, variance analyses indicated that high school teachers scored higher than primary and middle school teachers across all six measured factors, possibly due to the contextual demands of the university entrance examinations. Overall, the findings suggest a willingness among teachers to enhance their competencies for teaching AI, and underscore the need for increased attention on strengthening teachers' competencies to promote ethical judgement and design AI for social good. The validated survey should be a valid and reliable assessment tool for future teacher development initiatives.

AB  - In the last decade, research on the use of artificial intelligence technologies in education has steadily grown. Many studies have demonstrated the potential of these technologies to improve school administration processes, enhance students' learning experiences, simplify teachers' daily tasks, and broaden opportunities for lifelong learning. However, the enthusiasm surrounding these possibilities may overshadow the ethical challenges posed by these systems. This systematic literature review is designed to explore the ethical dimensions surrounding the utilisation of these technologies within the defined timeframe (2011-2022) in the field of education. It undertakes a thorough analysis of various applications and objectives, with a particular focus on pinpointing any inherent shortcomings within the existing body of literature. The paper discusses how cultural differences, inclusion, and emotions have been addressed in this context. Finally, it explores the capacity building efforts that have been put in place, their main targets, as well as guidelines and frameworks available for the ethical use of these systems. This review sheds light on the research's blind spots and provides insights to help rethink education ethics in the age of AI. Additionally, the paper explores implications for teacher training, as educators play a critical role in ensuring the ethical use of AI in education. This review aims to stimulate ethical debates around artificial intelligence that recognise it as a non-neutral tool, and to view it as an opportunity to strengthen the debates on the ethics of education itself.

AB  - Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) models, such as ChatGPT, may inherit or amplify societal biases due to their training on extensive datasets. With the increasing usage of GAI by students, faculty, and staff in higher education institutions (HEIs), it is urgent to examine the ethical issues and potential biases associated with this technology. This scoping review aims to elucidate how biases related to GAI in HEIs have been researched and discussed in recent academic publications. We categorized the potential biases that GAI might cause in the field of higher education. Our findings reveal that while there is meaningful scholarly discussion around bias and discrimination concerning GAI models in the AI field, most articles addressing higher education approach the issue superficially. Few articles identify specific types of bias in different higher education contexts, and there is a notable lack of empirical research. Most papers in our review focus primarily on educational and research fields related to medicine and engineering, with some addressing English education. However, there is almost no discussion regarding the humanities and social sciences. Additionally, a significant portion of the current discourse is in English and primarily addresses English-speaking contexts. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to categorize the potential biases that GAI might cause in the field of higher education. This review highlights the need for more in-depth studies and empirical work to understand the specific biases that GAI might introduce or amplify in educational settings, guiding the development of more ethical AI applications in higher education.

AB  - The role of artificial intelligence (AI) in education plays a crucial role in teacher training digitalisation. Although AI has enormous potential, not much is known about how pre-service teachers perceive and utilise AI tools in professional practice. Hence, this study, guided by the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology framework, investigates pre-service English as a foreign language teachers' experiences using MagicSchool, an AI-based educational tool, to design exam questions, aiming to explore how AI tools can enhance assessment practices in teacher education. Participants were 27 fourth-year pre-service teachers. Data for this case study were collected through semi-structured interviews and reflective reports and subsequently subjected to thematic analysis. The findings reveal that MagicSchool improved time efficiency and reinforced the creation of various question types. Participants also mentioned its practicality in generating rubrics and materials for varied proficiency levels. However, challenges such as crafting effective prompts, verifying content and addressing cultural or contextual mismatches were recognised. Moreover, ethical concerns, such as plagiarism and minimised creativity, were highlighted, with participants warning against over-reliance on AI. The study underscores the potential of AI in exam preparation while emphasising challenges, advocating for a balanced approach that integrates AI responsibly. Implications for teacher education include fostering AI literacy, promoting critical engagement with AI-generated content and ensuring ethical and pedagogically sound implementation in assessment design.

AB  - Recently, there has been a plethora of studies about students' attitudes toward the use of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in education, particularly in higher education and language education; however, research on AI use in high school settings has gained relatively little attention, leaving a huge research gap in the literature. This study seeks to address this research gap by examining high school students' attitudes toward using AI-powered tools in education in Cambodia. Utilizing evidence from an online survey with 315 students (female = 62.50%), the study showed that Cambodian high school students expressed generally favorable attitudes toward utilizing AI-powered tools in education, particularly pertaining to the use of AI to aid in completing school work. However, the study identified key concerns about data privacy and security issues, the risk of becoming over-dependent on AI, and limited originality about students' work. It was also found that students tended to be less concerned with the potential reduction in their critical thinking and creativity skills, and the possibility of receiving false or incorrect responses from AI. Key opportunities of using AI in education were also identified, including the potential to assist students in learning languages and help them summarize texts, translate languages, and/or brainstorm ideas. The study underscored the significance of developing students' AI literacy through training and awareness raising programs, and the importance of formulating comprehensive AI policies to promote the ethical and effective use of AI technologies in high school settings. The study concluded with some limitations and directions for future studies.

AB  - Recent advancements in generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) were accompanied by both hype and fear regarding the ways in which such technologies of automation would replace human labor in various fields, including education. Rather than focusing on the replacement of humans in teaching, this piece uses new materialist thought [Barad, Karen. 2007. "Meeting the Universe Halfway: Quantum Physics and the Entanglement of Matter and Meaning." Durham, NC: Duke University Press.] to consider how a new subjectivity, the centaur, might offer a different orientation toward GenAI technologies as tools that possess potentiality for new becomings in teaching. This theoretical piece looks at three AI education (AIED) platforms as a means of diagnosing how current models of AI tools attempt to design for teacher-centaurs by ushering in a more productive teacher workforce. The article also offers an alternative perspective of what might be considered centaur teaching practices, entangling humans and AI in ways that imagine how human-technical relations might be otherwise.

AB  - Society's future depends on informed perspectives of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and AI related skills, a prognosis that greatly impacts K-12 education. To best prepare students to be AI savvy, there is a need to integrate AI tools, skills, and lessons into the K-12 curriculum. In order for teachers to develop the knowledge and skills, and have the self-efficacy for using AI in instruction, they must be well prepared and informed of what AI is (and what it is not) and its potential role in K-12 education. This study explored teachers' (mis)conceptions relative to their intentional and informal learning. Our research provides important implications for teacher preparation and in-service professional development regarding AI in our society and implementation of AI tools and processes in K-12 education.

AB  - This book details a series of studies across several levels of learning and vocational education and training (VET) discipline areas. In the main, the advent of natural language AI chatbots exampled by ChatGPT, has caused the educational sector to take on a defensive stance. Both schools and the higher education sector are engaged in an on-going 'arms race' to prevent learners from using AI to augment assessments. Therefore, there has been a focus on plagiarism prevention, rather than to better understand the potentialities for utilizing AI to support better learning. This book explores the collaborative development and planning between educational developers/learning designers and teachers to design learning activities which could leverage off various artificial intelligence (AI) platforms. In doing, support is provided for effective learning to be undertaken with an emphasis on the learning and application of critical thinking skills. The studies presented through the volume, describe the integration of AI literacy, to support learners in evaluating the relevance and efficacy of AI tools and platforms, and to understand how to best utilize these for specific purposes. This book also synthesizes a framework for the introduction, selection, and implementation of AI into the VET curriculum. It showcases recommendations and guidelines to inform the future integration of AI tools/platforms into the VET curriculum.

AB  - Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, including large language models (LLMs) that can generate novel text output, present promise for creating tailored science communication for broad audiences. However, LLMs might reflect inaccuracies and social biases from their training sources. In this work, we examine the promises and challenges of using LLMs to depict climate issues from intersectional perspectives. We prompt an LLM (GPT-4) to generate content about localized climate issues and simulate different communication mediums and intersectional identities. We conduct content analysis of the responses, drawing from Intersectional Climate Justice and Culturally Sustaining Pedagogies frameworks. Findings suggest that the LLM-created responses can restate climate justice principles in the prompts and do not frequently show inaccuracy. However, they may lack elaboration, show deficit framing, and overlook identity aspects. We discuss suggestions from critical education research, to question the assumptions underlying AI technologies and explore ways to promote inclusive climate education.

AB  - This study investigates the psychological and pedagogical factors influencing K-12 teachers' readiness to integrate artificial intelligence (AI) into educational settings. An exploratory qualitative approach was employed, involving 66 teachers from 11 disciplines at a private school in Türkiye participating in a professional development program focused on AI-enhanced teaching. Data were collected through online discussion forums and AI-supported learning activity design tasks and analyzed using inductive thematic analysis. Findings reveal that teachers valued AI for its efficiency, interactivity, and adaptability, particularly in tools like ChatGPT and MagicSchool, which supported personalized learning and lesson planning. However, significant challenges emerged, including technical issues, curriculum misalignment, ethical concerns, and cultural barriers, such as difficulties adapting AI-generated content to local contexts. The study concludes that while AI offers significant potential to enhance education, successful integration requires addressing the identified barriers through targeted support, resources, and ethical guidelines. Implications for further research include exploring diverse educational settings to generalize findings, conducting longitudinal studies to assess long-term impacts, and investigating strategies to align AI tools with existing curricula and ethical standards.

AB  - Even while Artificial Intelligence (AI) has long been a part of our lives, it has recently received more attention thanks to the introduction of ChatGPT, a Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer, since its launch in November 2022. The focus of this study is to investigate the potential of ChatGPT to assess student-teacher learning, which looks at its use for online assessments in South Africa. It emphasizes South African lecturers' views of ChatGPT, an AI technology used for designing online assessments. The expansion of online assessments has brought about various adaptable tools and techniques, and ChatGPT provides benefits, including real-time interaction and personalized responses. Nevertheless, problems such as prejudices and circumstantial limitations still exist. Notwithstanding this, ChatGPT does well at assessing critical thinking by examining evidence-based reasoning and logical reliability. When integrating ChatGPT, ethical deliberations such as algorithmic transparency, data security, and privacy are crucial. Ten participants participated in a qualitative study that examined ChatGPT's effects on online assessment and student-teacher relationships using the Community of Inquiry (CoI) model. By presenting lecturers with AI-driven techniques and promoting innovation and technology integration, participants highlight their impact in promoting professional development. As a cooperative tool, ChatGPT offers tailored feedback, detailed instructions, and culturally appropriate rubrics that encourage critical thinking and introspection. It is essential, however, to contextualize its application to combat biases and cultural twists within the African educational environment. This ensures that rather than replacing student-teachers' knowledge, AI supports them using inclusive and valuable assessments.

AB  - The rise of Artificial Intelligence technology has raised concerns about the potential compromise of privacy due to the handling of personal data. Private AI prevents cybercrimes and falsehoods and protects human freedom and trust. While Federated Learning offers a solution by model training across decentralized devices or servers, thereby preserving data localization, it may leak client information through communicated gradients and parameters. Conventional defenses, such as dropout, GAN, and adversarial training, fail to either obstruct these attacks or significantly hamper model performance. This thesis centers on defending against gradient-based attacks in Federated Learning while upholding model efficiency and performance. As our first contribution, we introduce the pragmatic defense mechanism of Double-Blind Collaborative Learning (DBCL), which employs random matrix sketching on parameters and repeated sketching generation, achieving enhanced privacy without substantial computational overhead or lowering accuracy. Our primary investigation delves into byte coding for privacy in Natural Language Processing (NLP). This novel approach involves random-byte mapping with a subword fusion strategy, yielding promising experimental outcomes characterized by fortified privacy, memory efficiency, and accuracy. Notably, our approach obstructs an attacker's ability to reconstruct text token candidates for a batch of inputs, thus fortifying the resilience of private text in Federated Learning against potential recovery attempts, making the recovery of private data in federated learning much harder -- paving a way to a safer environment in both the real and virtual worlds.

AB  - Evidence from various domains underlines the critical role that human factors, and especially trust, play in adopting technology by practitioners. In the case of Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered tools, the issue is even more complex due to practitioners' AI-specific misconceptions, myths and fears (e.g., mass unemployment and privacy violations). In recent years, AI has been incorporated increasingly into K-12 education. However, little research has been conducted on the trust and attitudes of K-12 teachers towards the use and adoption of AI-powered Educational Technology (AI-EdTech). This paper sheds light on teachers' trust in AI-EdTech and presents effective professional development strategies to increase teachers' trust and willingness to apply AI-EdTech in their classrooms. Our experiments with K-12 science teachers were conducted around their interactions with a specific AI-powered assessment tool (termed AI-Grader) using both synthetic and real data. The results indicate that presenting teachers with some explanations of (i) how AI makes decisions, particularly compared to the human experts, and (ii) how AI can complement and give additional strengths to teachers, rather than replacing them, can reduce teachers' concerns and improve their trust in AI-EdTech. The contribution of this research is threefold. First, it emphasizes the importance of increasing teachers' theoretical and practical knowledge about AI in educational settings to gain their trust in AI-EdTech in K-12 education. Second, it presents a teacher professional development program (PDP), as well as the discourse analysis of teachers who completed it. Third, based on the results observed, it presents clear suggestions for future PDPs aiming to improve teachers' trust in AI-EdTech.

AB  - This study analyzed an AI chatbot's perspectives on adolescent sexting through quantitative questionnaire responses and a qualitative conversational interview. Findings revealed problematic biases stemming from limitations in training data and algorithms. The chatbot showed an imbalanced focus on sexting's risks compared to benefits for healthy sexual development. Responses frequently associated teen sexting with criminal offenses like child pornography, reflecting legalistic age bias. Gender bias also emerged in framing sexting as far riskier for girls versus boys. Additionally, the chatbot demonstrated gaps applying nuanced consent principles attuned to complex teen relationship dynamics. While covering consent fundamentals, responses lacked an understanding of how initial willingness differs from non-consensual sharing. The study suggests training data limitations skewed the chatbot's framing away from empowering adolescent sexual agency. Opportunities exist to mitigate biases through improving training data balance, incorporating community input, expanding consent frameworks and encouraging nuanced risk/benefit analysis. More inclusive design with human oversight is vital for chatbots to provide comprehensive, empowering sexuality education to youth. This analysis of AI perspectives reveals the persistence of conservative attitudes and the need to evolve systems to support healthy adolescent sexual development.

Design/methodology/approach: The review was done using a narrative approach by analyzing the latest international and national studies, research papers, blog posts, newspaper articles and documentaries, and by collecting the data, facts, figures and pictures. This narrative literature review approach provides a contextual understanding of how different English language teachers view ChatGPT in English writing pedagogy allowing for a comprehensive synthesis of data about its opportunities and challenges as well. It also helps in finding patterns and gaps in the body of knowledge, directing future studies and emphasizing areas that require more research, which is important for this new cutting-edge invention. The narrative approach, in contrast to systematic reviews, enables a detailed qualitative analysis that is necessary for delving into complex topics. This review offers useful insights into the prospects and practical challenges of integrating ChatGPT in English language writing pedagogy by concentrating on the experiences of teachers. The narrative literature review is a useful and relevant means of comprehending and using AI in educational settings since its ultimate goal is to synthesize current knowledge and provide practical recommendations for teachers, students, administrators and, last but not least, policymakers for the effective integration of ChatGPT as generative multimedia specifically in the English language writing pedagogy. Findings: Grounded on findings, it is essential to mention here that ChatGPT holds immense value in terms of English language writing pedagogy. The findings deal with the three research questions: each research question has a main theme followed by sub-themes about the views of teachers on ChatGPT integration into English writing pedagogy, its benefits and, last but not least, challenges; however, very few traces of AI have been found in the early most downloaded Language learning apps, but ChatGPT covers it all with the features like personalized learning, contextually adaptable feedback, human-like conversational skills and preparation of standard tests, which make ChatGPT stand apart and stand tall in the race of new AI inventions. On the contrary, the paper identifies vital challenges associated with ChatGPT. First, there is a severe concern that students' creativity may be at risk. Second, the concern of data privacy is a critical consideration. Finally, dealing with the trust issue of English language teachers regarding the use of ChatGPT for English language writing pedagogy and, last but not least, the paper also talks about low digital literacy as an additional challenge to integrating ChatGPT in educational settings. The incorporation of ChatGPT is not only a new trend but also a door to future AI wonders, so the education community needs to make the most of it. Practical implications: The paper has broad implications that address multiple aspects of educational theory, practice, policy and future research when incorporating AI systems such as ChatGPT into English language writing pedagogy. The findings imply that ChatGPT can result in more dynamic and customized learning experiences, which has important implications for improving English language writing pedagogy with the integration of ChatGPT. AI can help teachers customize lessons to each student's needs, which could increase student engagement in writing classes and improve learning results. Additionally, for the school administration and policymakers, the integration of ChatGPT depends upon access to smooth internet connection and other resources needed for effective learning of the students. Policymakers can develop policies as per the changing needs of the hour by providing professional development training to the teachers for the incorporation of AI inventions such as ChatGPT for English language writing pedagogy. Furthermore, the research also highlights significant ethical and policy issues, especially those dealing with academic integrity. Policies by the administration and teachers must be developed to stop students from misusing ChatGPT and to guarantee that AI tools are applied morally and responsibly in educational contexts because students can utilize the tool to complete assignments in an unethical manner. Originality/value: This narrative literature review is unique as it provides insights into the new invention of OpenAI ChatGPT from the education perspective, specifically about the teaching of English language writing pedagogy, and offers some exciting revelations that have not been done previously.

AB  - The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in language education necessitates new forms of digital leadership, yet research on how language teachers develop e-leadership competencies remains limited, particularly in non-Western contexts. This study investigates how Vietnamese EFL teachers develop and exercise e-leadership competencies in implementing AI tools. Using an exploratory sequential mixed-methods design, the study combined in-depth interviews with 17 EFL teachers and a survey of 211 teachers across Vietnamese universities. The research framework integrated e-Leadership Theory and the Technology Acceptance Model. Key findings reveal that successful e-leadership requires a balance of technical proficiency ([beta] = 0.31, p < 0.001) and cultural sensitivity ([beta] = 0.28, p < 0.001). Three primary dimensions of e-leadership competencies emerged: technological proficiency with guidance capability, pedagogical innovation in AI integration, and culturally responsive change management. The research also highlights critical ethical considerations in AI implementation, particularly regarding assessment transparency and decision-making processes. These findings inform the development of culturally sensitive professional development programs and provide a framework for understanding e-leadership development in non-Western educational settings.

AB  - This study examines the application of artificial intelligence (AI) writing tools in academic writing among Nigerian university students, highlighting both the potential benefits and significant challenges. With increasing numbers of people utilising AI-powered tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, and Quillbot, Nigerian academics and students demonstrate varying degrees of exposure and expertise in using such tools. The research, employing a purposive sampling technique, conducted interviews with 20 Nigerian students to examine their awareness, usage patterns, and reasons for utilising AI in academic research. The respondents were duly informed of their rights within the research and the choice to use it without consequences. Results show that although AI tools facilitate tasks such as data analysis and writing support, concerns about academic integrity, over-dependence, and institutional support issues persist. Interestingly, students report a lack of guidelines and official training, which leads to the ad hoc and potentially unethical use of AI. The paper concludes that systematic AI literacy programs and ethical guidelines are necessary for the responsible and fair integration of AI into Nigerian higher education, thereby assisting students' learning while promoting academic integrity.

AB  - This paper examines the Individualized Credit for Prior Learning (CPL) process in business education. It highlights its role in accrediting students' experiential learning and bridging practical experience with academic credit. This research then recommends solutions that include AI tools, advisor training, and centralized resource hubs. Most promisingly, integrating AI tools helps identify skills, suggests alignment with academic competencies, and provides personalized feedback on students' submissions. It also passes through the ethical dimensions of responsible AI implementation, like data privacy, fairness, and transparency. These findings suggest that advisor support, coupled with AI-enhanced tools, would not only increase the quality of submissions but also make the process more effective and accessible. Integration of this technology into the targeted support strategies will help the iCPL process serve a broader student population and thus foster greater inclusivity and lifelong learning opportunities in higher education.

AB  - This article aims to examine the opportunities and challenges of artificial intelligence (AI) in academic writing and research skills. It suggests recommendations that universities can use to develop to enhance the proper use of AI. As many institutions continue to embrace and use AI tools worldwide, questions surrounding its utilisation in the education sector continue to emerge. Following the continued adoption of AI in academia, several studies have been conducted to examine its impact. Some studies reveal that AI can be instrumental in scientific and academic research while inspiring new research topics and areas. However, universities in Kenya face challenges in tapping into AI opportunities and addressing the challenges associated with AI adoption, such as plagiarism and misinformation. Therefore, the main objective of this article was to analyse the gaps in AI in academic writing and research skills in Kenyan universities. It has two aims: firstly, it analyses the opportunities associated with AI tools in academic writing and research skills, and secondly, it examines the challenges Kenyan universities face in using AI tools. A semisystematic literature review from EBSCO and Google Scholar databases for peer-reviewed articles, policies, internet websites, government documents, parliamentary bills, online digital news, and institutional documents published since 2017 was conducted. Four key steps were used in literature identification: search, inclusion and exclusion criteria, development of themes, and analysis. Our findings suggest that adopting AI in academic writing and research skills is integral for quality research and academic integrity in universities. We recommend the formulation of AI policy frameworks that will regulate and support academic research integrity in universities. The findings will add to the available literature pool of knowledge on how Kenyan and other African universities are preparing to integrate AI into academia and will identify areas that need more attention from scholars to enhance the teaching and learning experience.

AB  - Background: The importance of high school completion for jobs and postsecondary opportunities is well- documented. Combined with federal laws where high school graduation rate is a core performance indicator, school systems and states face pressure to actively monitor and assess high school completion. This proposal employs machine learning techniques to identify students at-risk of exiting high school in either 9th or 10th grade. We argue that compared to students who may exit in later years of schooling, students who withdraw in the first two years are a vulnerable population and could benefit from earlier intervention, support, and services. This proposal advances the current state of knowledge in the field by (1) predicting early withdrawal of students who exit in 9th or 10th grade without eventual completion, and (2) assessing algorithmic bias for sensitive groups. Research Questions: This project investigates the following research questions to predict early exit from high school: 1: How does the prediction accuracy of supervised learning algorithms to predict high school withdrawal compare to that of traditional models (i.e., logistic regression)? 2: What are the most salient predictors of students who exit high school in 9th or 10th grade? 3: To what extent does each mode provide fair predictions across sensitive attributes such as gender, race/ethnicity, disability status, financial hardship, and English proficiency? Based on prior literature, we hypothesize that machine models will provide more predictive accuracy than an OLS regression. While there are clear hypotheses related to the importance of attendance, behavior, and coursework trajectories on high school completion, little is known about which of these aspects of middle school engagement are most predictive of exiting high school early. Setting: This project relies on existing administrative data housed at the North Carolina Education Research Data Center (NCERDC). We examine student educational records from 6th to 8th grade to predict the probability that a student will exit high school in 9th or 10th grade. The predictors include End-of- Grade test scores, attendance rates, chronic absenteeism, disciplinary infractions, school mobility, and urbanicity. Population: We examine first-time sixth-grade public school students during the 2011-2012 school year. We limit the sample to students in districts that follow a legal dropout age of 16 and those with complete graduation or exit records. We retain students who have some or all attendance and state test score data in middle grades and impute missing data with a student's unique middle school median. 94% of students in this cohort persist in the school system beyond 10th grade, compared to 6% who exit in 9th or 10th grade. Research Design: Like earlier empirical work, we compare prediction accuracy of a traditional logistic regression model to more advanced machine learning algorithms: lasso regression, ridge regression, random forests, and extreme gradient boosting (XGboost) (Mduma et al., 2019; Hung, 2017; Sansone, 2019; Coleman, 2021; Sorenson, 2018). We create binary classification models with an outcome of "1" for students who exited in 9th or 10th grade, and "0" otherwise. To evaluate model performance, we examine the area under curve (AUC), accuracy rate, sensitivity (true positive rate), specificity (true negative rate), and F-1 score. The results focus on sensitivity, or the accuracy rate for students who exit early. We follow standard machine learning practices and cross-validate models by using sixth-grade students in Fall 2010 as a training sample and sixth-grade students in Fall 2011 as a testing sample. We apply standard metrics of maximizing accuracy with parameters and hyperparameters that are standard for each algorithm. We rely on receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses and apply a decision threshold to achieve a true positive rate of 80%. To prevent the models from being biased towards the majority class, we address class imbalance by oversampling the minority class. Specifically, we apply Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to generate synthetic minority class observations based on the k-nearest neighbor for the minority class (Chawla et al. 2002; Fernandes et al. 2018; Anis & Ali, 2017). To examine if algorithms discriminate against certain student groups, we "blind" the algorithms to gender and race/ethnicity. We conduct an Absolute Between-ROC Area (ABROCA) slicing analysis to evaluate algorithmic fairness between the majority and minority group for student group. We focus on the following protected attributes: gender, race/ethnicity, English learner status, disability status, and economic disadvantage. Findings: We find that when models are trained with highly imbalanced data, both ensemble methods -- XGboost and random forest -- provide the highest sensitivity rate. However, we see substantial improvements in the sensitivity rates of all models that were trained with synthetic data (SMOTE). The improved accuracy in identifying the minor class comes at a penalty of a lower accuracy rate and lower specificity. Despite other models having higher sensitivity, we argue that the strongest model is with XGboost trained with SMOTE observations because it provides a higher specificity. In examining model features we find that age in 8th grade and being chronically absent in a middle school attendance are most predictive of early exit, followed by 8th grade and 7th grade absences. We detect no signs of algorithmic bias for students stratified by gender, disability status, and economic disadvantage. Conversely, we detected bias in regression-based models for students stratified by English learner status and race/ethnicity. Conclusion: Please see the Abstract PDF for the full updated abstract.

AB  - This research explores university educators' perspectives on the opportunities, concerns, and considerations associated with Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) in the training of professional communicators. Positioned at the early stages of ChatGPT's integration into educational settings, the study examines teachers' assignment instructions, assessments of ChatGPT's responses, and reflections on these outcomes. Employing a cross-sectional, qualitative methodology, the research involves a sample of 22 teachers from communication faculties in Mexico, Peru, and Spain. Utilizing Bloom's taxonomy and an inductive approach for data analysis, the findings unveil nuanced views on GenAI's role in teaching practice. Teachers perceive ChatGPT as a tool with varying impacts depending on its application. They articulate distinct roles for ChatGPT, viewing it as either an ally or a rival, prompting discussions on anthropomorphizing technologies and emphasizing the need to empower students in GenAI tool usage, establish ethical protocols, and reconsider assessment methods, among other key considerations.

AB  - In this study, in which artificial intelligence applications are examined at the K-12 level, the discussions are multi-dimensional. The use of artificial intelligence applications at the K-12 level, and especially the integrated use of online writing tools into the writing lessons, has led to the occurrence of plagiarism from time to time. In the first place, the fact that artificial intelligence applications create the feeling of being able to think like a human causes student to fully trust this software. What is more, when the subject is approached in terms of educational leadership, teachers' transfer of experience and high level of interaction during teaching and learning decreases. Because artificial intelligence applications individualize the education process and allow students to work more independently from the teacher and from peers. That being said, there are some points that are worth noting here. AI applications should be used as a tool, not an end because when these applications are utilized accountability cannot always be attained. The number of teachers who are already competent in informing and supervising students against malpractices is not sufficient. The fact that teachers are not fully competent in this respect poses a danger to the control and safety of the process. In order for artificial intelligence applications to be exercised effectively at the K-12 level, some software languages and coding skills must be acquired. Lastly, important steps need to be taken towards the future of artificial intelligence applications. Each country should include them in their education systems through their curricula from an early age along with AI applications. In this direction, teacher training programs should also be reviewed. It is of crucial importance to raise the awareness of the society on artificial intelligence, and about ethical rules and morality.

AB  - Questions around the use and regulation of Generative AI (GenAI) in educational contexts are widespread among both students and educators; an important step toward addressing these questions is to gain a full and nuanced understanding of the perspectives at play. To that end, this study surveyed 742 biology students across nine higher education institutions in Norway to understand their experiences with and perspectives on integrating GenAI tools into their education. Findings indicate that students support a balanced approach to integrating these tools, viewing platforms such as ChatGPT positively, primarily as supplementary learning aids. However, they raised concerns about ethics, accuracy, and bias and emphasized the need for institutional guidelines and training to support responsible use and enhance learning. This study aims to broaden perspectives from students globally and provide evidence that supports strategies to meet students' needs; in parallel, we advocate for designing effective educator-student partnerships as a means of exploring the best ways to use GenAI tools in higher education.

AB  - Social interactions among classroom peers, represented as social learning networks (SLNs), play a crucial role in enhancing learning outcomes. While SLN analysis has recently garnered attention, most existing approaches rely on centralized training, where data is aggregated and processed on a local/cloud server with direct access to raw data. However, in real-world educational settings, such direct access across multiple classrooms is often restricted due to privacy concerns. Furthermore, training models on isolated classroom data prevents the identification of common interaction patterns that exist across multiple classrooms, thereby limiting model performance. To address these challenges, we propose one of the first frameworks that integrates Federated Learning (FL), a distributed and collaborative machine learning (ML) paradigm, with SLNs derived from students' interactions in multiple classrooms' online forums to predict future link formations (i.e., interactions) among students. By leveraging FL, our approach enables collaborative model training across multiple classrooms while preserving data privacy, as it eliminates the need for raw data centralization. Recognizing that each classroom may exhibit unique student interaction dynamics, we further employ model personalization techniques to adapt the FL model to individual classroom characteristics. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in capturing both shared and classroom-specific representations of student interactions in SLNs. Additionally, we utilize explainable AI (XAI) techniques to interpret model predictions, identifying key factors that influence link formation across different classrooms. These insights unveil the drivers of social learning interactions within a privacy-preserving, collaborative, and distributed ML framework--an aspect that has not been explored before.

AB  - Assessment refers to a broad array of approaches for measuring or evaluating a person's (or group of persons') skills, behaviors, dispositions, or other attributes. Assessments range from standardized tests used in admissions, employee selection, licensure examinations, and domestic and international large-scale assessments of cognitive and behavioral skills to formative K-12 classroom curricular assessments. The various types of assessments are used for a wide variety of purposes, but they also have many common elements, such as standards for their reliability, validity, and fairness--even classroom assessments have standards. We believe the future of assessment will involve a shift in emphasis on what skills will be measured, innovations in how we go about measuring them, the use of advanced technologies for test operations, and an expansion in the value and kinds of information that test takers will receive from taking the assessment. In this paper, we argue and provide evidence for our belief that the future of assessment contains challenges but is promising. The challenges include risks associated with security and exposure of personal data, test score bias, and inappropriate test uses, all of which may be exacerbated by the growing infiltration of artificial intelligence (AI) into our lives. The promise is increasing opportunities for testing to help individuals achieve their education and career goals and contribute to well-being and overall quality of life. To help achieve this promise we focus on the evidence-based science of measurement in education and workplace learning, a theme throughout this paper.

AB  - Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being utilized to develop tools and services in various domains, including education. However, due to the nature of the training data, these models are susceptible to inherent social or cognitive biases, which can influence their outputs. Furthermore, their handling of critical topics, such as privacy and sensitive questions, is essential for responsible deployment. This study proposes a framework for the automatic detection of biases and violations of responsible use using a synthetic question-based dataset mimicking student-chatbot interactions. We employ the LLM-as-a-judge method to evaluate multiple LLMs for biased responses. Our findings show that some models exhibit more bias than others, highlighting the need for careful consideration when selecting models for deployment in educational and other high-stakes applications. These results emphasize the importance of addressing bias in LLMs and implementing robust mechanisms to uphold responsible AI use in real-world services.

AB  - This qualitative research aims to examine the artificial intelligence literacy levels of psychological counseling candidates. Within the scope of the research, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 3rd and 4th-year students of the Guidance and Psychological Counseling program, and the views of 18 participants were analyzed. The data were processed using thematic analysis with the QDA Miner Lite 3.0 program. According to the research findings, participants stated that artificial intelligence lacks human aspects but can function as a support assistant for psychological counselors. In terms of ethical issues, privacy concerns were prominent, and some participants expressed that artificial intelligence could help resolve ethical dilemmas. In the context of future-oriented views, it was emphasized that artificial intelligence literacy should be increased, integrated into the curriculum, and current technologies should be followed. Concerns about trust and danger indicate that confidence in artificial intelligence needs to be increased. Regarding usage problems and purposes, it was stated that the correct and effective use of artificial intelligence could increase the efficiency of counseling processes. The research reveals a significant gap in artificial intelligence literacy among psychological counseling candidates and highlights the need to strengthen education in this area. The majority of participants have limited knowledge about artificial intelligence, showing the necessity of placing more emphasis on this topic in educational programs. Additionally, it is understood that artificial intelligence tools currently used in psychological counseling practice will play an even more critical role in the future. The study emphasizes that to support the professional advancement of psychological counseling candidates, their artificial intelligence literacy levels must be increased.

AB  - This article critically examines Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED) within English as a Second Language (ESL) contexts, arguing that current practices often deepen systemic inequality. Drawing on Iris Marion Young's "Five Faces of Oppression," we analyze the implementation of AIED in oppressed schools, illustrating how students are tracked into the consumer track--passive users of AI technologies--while privileged students are directed into the creator track, where they learn to design and develop AI. This divide reinforces systemic inequality, depriving disadvantaged students of communicative agency and social mobility. Focusing on the Israeli context, we demonstrate how teachers and students in these schools lack the training and infrastructure to engage meaningfully with AI, resulting in its instrumental rather than transformative use. This "veil of innovation" obscures educational injustice, masking deep inequalities in access, agency, and technological fluency. We advocate for an inclusive pedagogy that integrates AI within English education as a tool for empowerment--not as a replacement for linguistic and cognitive development.

AB  - Purpose: This paper examines the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in organizational training and development through an evidence-based lens, addressing the gap between technological enthusiasm and pedagogical effectiveness in workplace learning contexts. Design/methodology/approach: An integrative literature review methodology was employed following Torraco's (2016) framework for synthesizing diverse knowledge streams. The analysis examined 180 papers from multiple databases, combining theoretical frameworks from social cognitive theory (Bandura, 1986) and organizational learning theory (Dittmar et al., 2025) to develop an integrated conceptual framework. Findings: The analysis reveals critical misalignments between current AI implementation practices and established learning principles. While AI demonstrates effectiveness in personalized content delivery and routine skill development, significant challenges emerge in supporting transformative learning and maintaining social learning dynamics. Cultural variations and ethical considerations substantially influence implementation success. Originality/value: This paper contributes an integrated theoretical framework bridging individual and organizational learning perspectives in AI contexts, identifies specific gaps between technological capabilities and pedagogical requirements and proposes evidence-based guidance for practitioners navigating AI implementation decisions.

AB  - Progress made in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in recent years has resulted in these tools becoming more accessible for individuals who lack professional training. Of particular note are large language models, such as OpenAI's GPT-3.5. Discussions of utilizing AI for language education usually focus on the impact the technology will have on students and teachers. Less frequently the center of attention is how generative AI tools can empower researchers. The purpose of this paper is to raise awareness by demonstrating and discussing examples of how OpenAI's chatbot, ChatGPT, can be leveraged as a tool for language education researchers. After briefly introducing the use of AI generative tools in the field, this paper demonstrates how a researcher, without any understanding of NLP or AI, may use ChatGPT to assist with research through multiple means, including approaches to its use for compiling and summarizing information, and as a research assistant throughout multiple steps of research. This is followed by a discussion of potential ethical concerns of using AI for research in the field. We conclude by issuing a call for further work examining how researchers can harness the potential of this technology in ethical ways.

AB  - This study investigates how generative AI technologies influence pre-service teachers' pedagogical thinking and instructional design practices within a vocational education context. Drawing on a qualitative framework, the research engaged students in a task-based learning environment that integrated tools such as ChatGPT and image generators into authentic teaching design tasks. Data were collected through reflective journals, interviews, and teaching artifacts. Thematic analysis revealed three core trajectories of professional growth: (1) a shift from uncertainty to confidence in using AI tools; (2) the situated development of TPACK through iterative design and reflection; and (3) the emergence of critical awareness regarding AI ethics, accuracy, and bias. Students not only explored how AI could support their instructional creativity, but also expressed concerns about content reliability and the limitations of automated outputs. Their reflections illustrated an evolving understanding of AI not just as a tool, but as a coparticipant in instructional reasoning. The findings suggest that meaningful integration of generative AI requires more than technical training; it calls for pedagogical framing, ethical discourse, and reflective space. Teacher education programs must therefore cultivate not only AI fluency, but also critical and adaptive instructional mindsets capable of navigating the complexities of AI-supported teaching.

AB  - Research on bias in artificial intelligence has grown exponentially in recent years, especially around racial bias. Many modern technologies which impact people's lives have been shown to have significant racial biases, including automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. Emerging studies have found that widely-used ASR systems function much more poorly on the speech of Black people. Yet, this work is limited because it lacks a deeper consideration of the sociolinguistic literature on African American Language (AAL). In this paper, then, we seek to integrate AAL research into these endeavors to analyze ways in which ASRs might be biased against the linguistic features of AAL and how the use of biased ASRs could prove harmful to speakers of AAL. Specifically, we (1) provide an overview of the ways in which AAL has been discriminated against in the workforce and healthcare in the past, and (2) explore how introducing biased ASRs in these areas could perpetuate or even deepen linguistic discrimination. We conclude with a number of questions for reflection and future work, offering this document as a resource for cross-disciplinary collaboration.

AB  - The growing demand for microcredentials in education and workforce development necessitates scalable, accurate, and fair assessment systems for both soft and hard skills based on students' lived experience narratives. Existing approaches struggle with the complexities of hierarchical credentialing and the mitigation of algorithmic bias related to gender and ethnicity. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning framework that integrates hierarchical classification based on dynamic thresholding with a dual deep Q network dueling (DDQN dueling) for bias mitigation. Our method improves predictive performance at all three levels of microcredential classification, achieving an increase in 7% sensitivity and an improvement in 6% specificity over baseline models. Furthermore, our framework significantly improves fairness by reducing gender and ethnicity bias, as measured by equalized odds, by over 20% compared to conventional approaches. Extensive evaluations on a dataset of 3,000 student narratives demonstrate a 12% improvement in the F1 score and a 5% increase in AUROC relative to existing methods. These results underscore the effectiveness of our approach in advancing both hierarchical classification accuracy and fairness in real-world educational applications.

AB  - The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into language instruction has presented new opportunities, with ChatGPT emerging as a promising tool for interactive and personalized learning. This systematic review examines the effectiveness, advantages, and drawbacks of the ChatGPT in English language teaching (ELT). To achieve this objective, peer-reviewed studies published between 2023 and 2024 were sourced from the Web of Science database and focused on those that explored ChatGPT for language instruction. Using standardized criteria, data extraction covered the study design, participants, interventions, outcomes, and quality assessments. The findings indicate that the ChatGPT significantly improves language teaching by providing personalized feedback, fostering learner autonomy, enhancing student motivation and engagement, and facilitating specific language skills. Moreover, its ability to simulate real-life conversations makes it an effective tool to improve language fluency and comprehension. Nevertheless, challenges have been highlighted, such as overreliance on AI, academic dishonesty, skill deterioration, biases in AI-generated content, and the digital divide affecting access to AI technology. Integrating AI into existing educational frameworks and addressing the need for teacher training have also emerged as significant concerns. The implications are provided based on these findings.

Thematic analysis revealed three core trajectories of professional growth: (1) a shift from uncertainty to confidence in using AI tools; (2) the situated development of TPACK through iterative design and reflection; and (3) the emergence of critical awareness regarding AI ethics, accuracy, and bias. Students not only explored how AI could support their instructional creativity, but also expressed concerns about content reliability and the limitations of automated outputs. Their reflections illustrated an evolving understanding of AI not just as a tool, but as a co-participant in instructional reasoning. The findings suggest that meaningful integration of generative AI requires more than technical training; it calls for pedagogical framing, ethical discourse, and reflective space. Teacher education programs must therefore cultivate not only AI fluency, but also critical and adaptive instructional mindsets capable of navigating the complexities of AI-supported teaching.

AB  - Technologies like ChatGPT and other AI tools have impacted learning by giving students more chances to ask questions and explore knowledge. The inclusion of Non-Player Characters (NPCs) as scaffolding in game-based situated learning activities can have a positive impact on learning. The application of ChatGPT to role-playing has potential; therefore, this study designed a "ChatGPT-based NPCs scaffolding Workflow Framework" and used it as the basis for designing and evaluating an educational game for employee ethics training with empirical evidence. This study had 61 participants, divided into a document scaffolding group (n = 32) and a ChatGPT-based NPC group (n = 29) and examined the learning achievement, flow, motivation, and anxiety in the two groups. The results showed that the designs of both groups benefited learning achievement, and both groups could maintain a certain level of high motivation and engagement. Through qualitatively analyzing the content of students' discussions with NPCs, it was found that there is potential for NPC-assisted learning through ChatGPT. Overall, this study explored the efficacy and limitations of using ChatGPT-based NPCs as scaffolding in game-based learning and found that it is extensible. We also present a framework for the design of ChatGPT-based NPCs scaffolding mechanism.

AB  - With the increasing demand brought on by the beginning of the fourth industrial revolution in the period of post-digital education and bio-digital technology, artificial intelligence (AI) has played a pivotal role in supporting human intelligence and contributing to intellectuals within science, technology, science, and mathematics (STEM) and in the broader field of higher education. Thus, this study examines how writers for mainstream STEM journals and higher education magazines perceive the impact of ChatGPT, a powerful AI chatbot, on STEM research and higher education. ChatGPT can generate realistic texts based on user prompts. However, this platform also poses ethical challenges for academic integrity, authorship, and publication.Using a comparative media discourse analysis approach, this study analyzes 72 articles from four media outlets: (a) Springer Nature; (b) The Chronicle of Higher Education; (c) Inside Higher Ed; and (d) Times Higher Education. The results show that the writers expressed various concerns and opinions about the potential conflicts and crises caused by ChatGPT in three areas: (a) academic research and publication; (b) teaching and learning; and (c) human resources management.This study concludes with some policy implications and suggestions for future research on ChatGPT and AI ethics in academia by reilluminating the most overarching policy concerns related to ethical writing in STEM research and higher education and limitations to the blindness to authorship and academic integrity among diverse stakeholders.

AB  - Despite the critical role teachers play in AI education, research on their understanding of generative AI tools remains limited, particularly concerning their ethical assessment knowledge. This study addresses the gap by proposing the Generative AI Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (GenAI-TPACK) framework, which incorporates ethical knowledge as an essential component of university teachers' professional development. Grounded in the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) model, we utilize structural equation modeling to investigate the interrelationships among Generative AI Technological Knowledge, pedagogical knowledge, and ethical assessment knowledge. Our findings indicate that university teachers' effective use of generative AI is contingent upon their technological knowledge and engagement with these tools. Furthermore, while technical knowledge supports evaluative decision-making, it is insufficient on its own for successful integration into teaching practices. Instead, a holistic approach that combines technological and pedagogical knowledge enhances teachers' capacities to utilize generative AI effectively. The study also reveals a positive correlation between ethical assessment knowledge and both pedagogical and content knowledge, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of the GenAI-TPACK framework. This research underscores the importance of integrating ethical considerations into AI education, offering valuable insights for the professional development of educators and the enhancement of teacher training programs.

AB  - Learning analytics (LA), like much of machine learning, assumes the training and test datasets come from the same distribution. Therefore, LA models built on past observations are (implicitly) expected to work well for future observations. However, this assumption does not always hold in practice because the dataset may drift. Recently, algorithmic fairness has gained significant attention. Nevertheless, algorithmic fairness research has paid little attention to dataset drift. Majority of the existing fairness algorithms are "statically" designed. Put another way, LA models tuned to be "fair" on past data are expected to still be "fair" when dealing with current/future data. However, it is counter-intuitive to deploy a statically fair algorithm to a nonstationary world. There is, therefore, a need to assess the impact of dataset drift on the unfairness of LA models. For this reason, we investigate the relationship between dataset drift and unfairness of LA models. Specifically, we first measure the degree of drift in the features (i.e., covariates) and target label of our dataset. After that, we train predictive models on the dataset and evaluate the relationship between the dataset drift and the unfairness of the predictive models. Our findings suggest a directly proportional relationship between dataset drift and unfairness. Further, we find covariate drift to have the most impact on unfairness of models as compared to target drift, and there are no guarantees that a once fair model would consistently remain fair. Our findings imply that "robustness" of fair LA models to dataset drift is necessary before deployment.

AB  - Education should strive to keep pace with the developments of the modern world and to fulfill its mission by not deviating from the principles of ethical and effective learning. In this process, it continues to be tested by unstoppable technological developments. GAI, with both its positive and negative effects, has spread incredibly quickly to every aspect of our lives. This study, which deals with GAI especially in the context of higher education, aims to evaluate the benefits and limitations of GAI on a common ground. In this context, both academicians and university students were asked to express their views on the current situation regarding the use of AI in higher education and their suggestions for the use of AI in higher education. In the study conducted within the framework of qualitative research, semi-structured interview forms prepared by the researchers were answered by 36 university students and 14 academicians. Academicians and students advocated the need for improvement in the use of GAIs, especially in terms of ease of access to information and teaching/learning support. In addition, it was stated that there are ethical problems in use; they stated that it would be important to take precautions and provide general awareness trainings.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) technology is already challenging a variety of societal areas, including education. It is transforming education to data driven. AI-enhanced technologies in education (abbreviated AIinED) will have a significant role in changing the teaching and learning methods, as well as impacting the behavior and organization of the educational system. It is considered that the AIinED will change the paradigm of education in the future. And yet, AIinED is still more in the lab than being practically implemented in education and training. We consider three major players in the implementation of AIinED -- students, teachers, and society. All three can benefit from AIinED and at the same time be a potential target of the risks that AIinED brings along with its promises -- may be one of the reasons why main stakeholders (UNESCO, EC etc.) have been developing guidelines and recommendations for ethical use of AIinED. The literature shows that the center of AIinED system will be the student, but we consider the student not only as a target but also as a source of ideas for AIinED development with the potential to accelerate the process of adoption of AIinED. Hence, one of the big questions should be how the students foresee the role of artificial intelligence in education. To initiate such a question, though, it is important to know the level of understanding among the students about what and where artificial intelligence is. There are three major aspects that AIinED must be considered accordingly -- technological, lawful, and ethical. This paper presents the results of a study on high school students' understanding of AI technologies and their attitudes to their application in education. A survey was used as a tool to elaborate. The conceptual model of the research was developed on the basis of established theories linking attitudes to behavior and the acceptance of artificial intelligence technologies in education. Each element of this concept is explored with a different part of the questionnaire, which contains a total of 12 questions (some of which with sub-questions). The survey was elaborated online within October-November 2021. A link to the questionnaire in Bulgarian was provided to 178 high and vocational high schools educating students aged 14-19 (grades 8-12) across the country (Bulgaria). 766 students submitted their replies through the online survey form. Descriptive statistics and analysis of the frequencies of the respondents' opinions were made based on the data. The results show that the students participating in the survey:(a) understand the essence of AI technologies; (b) they are convinced of the usefulness of the application of artificial intelligence technologies in their daily activities and strongly believe that it improves it; (c) are not entirely clear about the benefits of artificial intelligence enhanced technologies in learning and teaching; (d) do not demonstrate sufficient knowledge and understanding of the necessity of ethical use of AI technologies in education; The latter reduces the positive influence of the perceived usefulness of artificial intelligence technologies in the learning process on students' attitudes.

AB  - Aim/Purpose: This study examined the understudied perceptions of higher education instructors on the use of art-based AI generators in digital art, design, and creative-based courses and answered the research questions: (1) how disruptions by generative artificial intelligence (GenAIs) are impacting teaching, and (2) what are the major factors that contribute to a healthy digital art ecosystem in higher education. Background: While GenAI has attracted widespread public attention, there is insufficient research on integrating art-based AI generators in digital art and design classrooms. Concurrently, there is a demand for collecting and integrating faculty and educators' perspectives, which are key stakeholders in preparing future art and design professionals for the GenAI-driven workforce. Our study is presented against such a backdrop. Methodology: The study incorporated a mixed-method approach to analyze survey data collected from higher education faculty on their perception of text-to-image generators. Quantitative data was analyzed through statistical analysis, and qualitative data was analyzed through a blend of human-AI thematic analysis. Contribution: The study provides empirical data on higher education faculty's perspectives regarding the implications of art-based AI generators through survey and mixed-method analysis, serving as a baseline for further research and the development of AI literacy interventions. Additionally, the research identifies effective pedagogical strategies and best practices for embedding generative AI into teaching and learning, contributing to the field of education. Findings: Art-based GenAIs create both positive disruptions (e.g., improved ideation, problem-solving, and creative processes) and negative disruptions (e.g., ethical implications, technical limitations, and pedagogical concerns) in higher education. Insufficient AI literacy and inadequate resources among faculty significantly set back the effective adoption of GenAIs in classrooms. Ethical issues, including academic integrity, copyright, and bias, emerge as prominent issues requiring the implementation of responsible AI frameworks and policies. Adopting pedagogical strategies, such as action-based learning, experimental learning, and active learning, can help optimize student engagement and enhance learning outcomes. Last but not least, a healthy digital art ecosystem in higher education hinges on responsible AI use and standards, continuous technological improvement, effective educational support, a human-centered approach, and a strong sense of community and collaboration. Recommendations for Practitioners: The paper recommends increasing AI literacy among faculty through professional development programs and collaborative learning initiatives; developing and implementing responsible AI use policies, guidelines, and frameworks to address ethical concerns and ensure the effective and ethical use of GenAIs in classrooms; and integrating pedagogical strategies such as action-based learning, experimental learning, and active learning to enhance student engagement and learning outcomes with GenAIs. Recommendation for Researchers: The paper recommends conducting further research on the integration of art-based generative AI in digital art and design classrooms across all academic levels; further exploring faculty and educators' perspectives on GenAI use to develop best practices and frameworks for effective and ethical adoption in higher education; and investigating the long-term impacts of GenAI technologies on teaching and learning in art, design, and creative-integrated disciplines through longitudinal studies. Impact on Society: The larger implications of the paper's findings include promoting awareness and education on the ethical implications, benefits, and limitations of GenAIs to foster responsible use and acceptance; encouraging interdisciplinary collaboration to address the challenges and opportunities presented by GenAIs in the creative and cultural industries; and supporting the development of a healthy digital art ecosystem that balances human creativity with technological advancements, ensuring inclusivity, accessibility, and sustainability. Future Research: Based on drawbacks that emerged from the study, such as the sampling method and the sample size, future research should focus on targeting larger and more diverse samples from across different regions of the United States, as well as integrating objective measures to complement self-reported data. As this research is focused on text-to-image generators, future research should expand to additional GenAI types and models to deepen our understanding of their potential benefits and use impacts. Additionally, future research would benefit from studying the long-term impacts of GenAIs on education and the development of human-centered solutions and interventions tailored for faculty and students.

AB  - Assessment refers to a broad array of approaches for measuring or evaluating a person's (or group of persons') skills, behaviors, dispositions, or other attributes. Assessments range from standardized tests used in admissions, employee selection, licensure examinations, and domestic and international largescale assessments of cognitive and behavioral skills to formative K-12 classroom curricular assessments. The various types of assessments are used for a wide variety of purposes, but they also have many common elements, such as standards for their reliability, validity, and fairness--even classroom assessments have standards (Klinger et al., 2015). The authors believe the future of assessments will involve a shift in emphasis on what skills will be measured, innovations in how one goes about measuring them, the use of advanced technologies for test operations, and an expansion in the value and kinds of information that test-takers will receive from taking the assessment. In this paper, the authors argue and provide evidence for the belief that the future of assessment contains challenges but is promising. The challenges include risks associated with security and exposure of personal data, test score bias, and inappropriate test uses, all of which may be exacerbated by the growing infiltration of artificial intelligence (AI) into people's lives. The promise is increasing opportunities for testing to help individuals achieve their education and career goals and contribute to well-being and overall quality of life. To help achieve this promise the authors focus on the evidence-based science of measurement in education and workplace learning, a theme throughout this paper. The first section of the paper reviews evidence for the value of assessment and discusses how the role of assessment may expand as skills become the new currency. The many purposes of assessment are discussed, from high-stakes examinations and selection tests to low-stakes formative assessments. The emerging challenges to testing and assessment, related to perceptions about their value, their focus, validity, fairness and equity concerns, are reviewed. The authors conclude the first section with a discussion of the prospects for the future of assessments, including the capacity of assessment to provide useful information to test-takers, the importance of identifying key skills and advancing methods for assessing hard-to-measure skills, and the importance of providing opportunities with personalized feedback. The remaining sections of the paper address those themes. The intended audience for this report is broad-ranging from the international scientific community in areas engaged in assessment, particularly education and workforce, to policy-makers and funders in those areas. The authors try to strike a balance between technical detail and accessibility to the broad audience.

AB  - This study explores Saudi undergraduate students' perceptions of artificial intelligence (AI) tools in academic writing. Despite extensive research on AI in higher education, there is limited focus on academic writing, especially in the Saudi context. A survey of 189 students, proficient in English and enrolled in freshmen academic writing courses, was conducted. The students frequently used ChatGPT, Grammarly, and Google Translate. Exploratory factor analysis identified two factors: "instructional support of AI tools" and "instructional practices of AI tools," explaining 55.302% of the variance. Descriptive analysis revealed strong student agreement on AI tools' benefits, including idea generation, outline preparation, grammar and spell-check improvements, and time-saving. However, concerns about reliability, contextual accuracy, and ethical implications were noted. The study indicates the need for proper training and clear guidelines to make the most of AI in academic writing. The participants, in various responses, indicated how AI helps develop their writing accuracy and come up with new ideas although some participants worry about relying too much on technology. The study recommends that AI tools can be very helpful, but we need to use them thoughtfully to cater to different student experiences and concerns.

AB  - Artificial intelligence is the driving force of change focusing on the needs and demands of the student. The research explores Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIEd) for building personalised learning systems for students. The research investigates and proposes a framework for AIEd: social networking sites and chatbots, expert systems for education, intelligent mentors and agents, machine learning, personalised educational systems and virtual educational environments. These technologies help educators to develop and introduce personalised approaches to master new knowledge and develop professional competencies. The research presents a case study of AIEd implementation in education. The scholars conducted the experiment in educational establishments using artificial intelligence in the curriculum. The scholars surveyed 184 second-year students of the Institute of Pedagogy and Psychology at the Abay Kazakh National Pedagogical University and the Kuban State Technological University to collect the data. The scholars considered the collective group discussions regarding the application of artificial intelligence in education to improve the effectiveness of learning. The research identified key advantages to creating personalised learning pathways such as access to training in 24/7 mode, training in virtual contexts, adaptation of educational content to personal needs of students, real-time and regular feedback, improvements in the educational process and mental stimulations. The proposed education paradigm reflects the increasing role of artificial intelligence in socio-economic life, the social and ethical concerns artificial intelligence may pose to humanity and its role in the digitalisation of education. The current article may be used as a theoretical framework for many educational institutions planning to exploit the capabilities of artificial intelligence in their adaptation to personalized learning.

AB  - This study explores the capability of academic staff assisted by the Turnitin Artificial Intelligence (AI) detection tool to identify the use of AI-generated content in university assessments. 22 different experimental submissions were produced using Open AI's ChatGPT tool, with prompting techniques used to reduce the likelihood of AI detectors identifying AI-generated content. These submissions were marked by 15 academic staff members alongside genuine student submissions. Although the AI detection tool identified 91% of the experimental submissions as containing AI-generated content, only 54.8% of the content was identified as AI-generated, underscoring the challenges of detecting AI content when advanced prompting techniques are used. When academic staff members marked the experimental submissions, only 54.5% were reported to the academic misconduct process, emphasising the need for greater awareness of how the results of AI detectors may be interpreted. Similar performance in grades was obtained between student submissions and AI-generated content (AI mean grade: 52.3, Student mean grade: 54.4), showing the capabilities of AI tools in producing human-like responses in real-life assessment situations. Recommendations include adjusting the overall strategies for assessing university students in light of the availability of new Generative AI tools. This may include reducing the overall reliance on assessments where AI tools may be used to mimic human writing, or by using AI-inclusive assessments. Comprehensive training must be provided for both academic staff and students so that academic integrity may be preserved.

AB  - Scientific modeling is a vital educational practice that helps students apply scientific knowledge to real-world phenomena. Despite advances in AI, challenges in accurately assessing such models persist, primarily due to the complexity of cognitive constructs and data imbalances in educational settings. This study addresses these challenges by employing diverse analytic strategies, including the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), aimed at enhancing fairness and efficacy in automated scoring systems. We analyze the impact of these strategies through a robust methodology, utilizing a combination of tenfold cross-validation and independent testing phases to ensure the reliability of AI assessments. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of deep learning AI in mirroring human judgment, with improvements in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores across varied model assessments. Specifically, the application of SMOTE significantly improved the scoring fairness for minority class instances, which are often underrepresented in educational datasets. This study also delves into the discrepancies between AI and human evaluations, particularly in interpreting creatively expressed student models, which reveals the areas where AI technologies require further enhancements to better align with human evaluative standards. This study lays a foundation for future research to explore advanced AI techniques and training strategies, thus promoting fair and supportive feedback mechanisms that enhance student learning and creativity. By advancing AI applications in science education, this research addresses essential challenges in the automated analysis of complex student responses and supports broader academic goals.

AB  - Introduction: The proliferation and accessibility of generative artificial intelligence (AI) have led to strong reactions across the academia. Statement of the Problem: Teachers can adapt to the availability of AI by integrating disclosure statements about its use into courses, which may promote student learning. Literature Review: Suggestions to include AI disclosure statements from academia and industry align with several of the major goals of the "APA Guidelines for the Undergraduate Major 3.0." Teaching Implications: Incorporating use of AI disclosure statements may support students' achievement of APA learning outcomes. These statements ask students to disclose their use of AI and consist of the AI "Model" used, the exact "Input" provided, and a description of how the student "Evaluated" the content ("MInE"). Disclosures are advantageous over other methods because of their flexibility and straightforwardness. Conclusion: When students use AI and disclose their usage, they may learn to communicate ethically and clearly, employ their knowledge of psychology to fact-check output, and develop the skill of disclosure, which is becoming more popular in academic and other professional settings.

AB  - Background/purpose: Neurodiversity, including ASD, ADHD, and dyslexia, has a powerful impact on the learning processes and interaction with education. As fairness issues are growing in technology-enhanced learning (TEL), it is high time to trace research trends and critical contributors, as well as release new themes in this area. This paper examines the current scholarship on neurodiversity and education in the world over the period of 2010 to 2025 to illuminate intellectual frameworks and new trends. Materials/methods: The bibliometric analysis concerned 336 articles obtained from Scopus. VOSviewer was used to map co-authorship, cocitation, and keyword co-occurrence. Analyses focused on academic production, country leadership, institutions, and thematic areas informing the world of research. Results: The results indicate a gradual increase in publications over the last decade, with significant contributions from the United States, United Kingdom, and Italy. Harvard University and Vanderbilt University became the top institutions. Three key research clusters were found: (1) Cognitive and Psychological Studies, which centered on the idea of executive functioning and learning difficulties in neurodiverse students; (2) Educational Technology and Learning Strategies, which centered on the concept of adaptive systems and approaches to dealing with the neurodiversity issue; and (3) Assistive Technology and Artificial Intelligence, which revolved around the idea of AI and virtual reality in supporting the neurodiversity issue. Despite advances, obstacles persist in terms of access and socio-economic disparities. Conclusion: Technology-based learning helps in meeting UN Sustainable Development Goal 4 (Quality Education), yet needs more policy changes, wider access to AI tools, and training of specific teachers to provide equal opportunities. Future research should focus on longitudinal assessments of TEL interventions and address ethical issues related to the use of AI in learning.

AB  - The rapid advancement of powerful Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and Llama, has revolutionized the world by bringing new creative possibilities and enhancing productivity. However, these advancements also pose significant challenges and risks, including the potential for misuse in the form of fake news, academic dishonesty, intellectual property infringements, and privacy leaks. In response to these concerns, this thesis explores approaches to promoting the responsible use of LLMs from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. Three key approaches are presented: (1) Detecting AI-generated Text via Watermarking: We propose a robust and high-quality watermarking method called Unigram-Watermark and introduce a rigorous theoretical framework to quantify the effectiveness and robustness of LLM watermarks. Furthermore, we propose PF-Watermark, which achieves the best balance of high detection accuracy and low perplexity. (2) Protecting the Intellectual Property of LLMs: We safeguard the intellectual property of LLMs through novel watermarking techniques designed to prevent model-stealing attacks in both text classification and text generation tasks. (3) Privacy-Preserving LLMs: We employ Confidential Redacted Training (CRT) to train and fine-tune language generation models while protecting sensitive information. In summary, we propose a suite of algorithms and solutions to address LLMs' trending safety, security, and privacy concerns. We hope our studies provide valuable insights for researchers to explore exciting future research solutions that promote responsible AI development and deployment.

AB  - This qualitative study explores lecturers' perspectives on the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in personalised learning within higher education. The rapid proliferation of AI has introduced numerous ethical challenges, including the potential for academic dishonesty and misuse. One concern highlighted in this study is maintaining academic integrity while fostering responsible and ethical AI use in educational contexts. Grounded in the Technology Acceptance Model, the research examines how lecturers navigate these complexities through innovative teaching and assessment strategies. Data were collected from 16 lecturers via open-ended questionnaires, and thematic analysis, guided by Braun and Clarke's six-step framework, was employed to identify recurring themes. The study is limited in its reliance on self-reported data, which may not fully capture the nuances of lecturers' experiences or practices. Additionally, the study is context-specific, focusing on a limited sample size, which may restrict the generalizability of the findings to broader contexts. Findings reveal that lecturers employ strategies such as using AI-detection tools like Turnitin to uphold academic integrity, redesigning assessments to include in-class components, and encouraging transparency by having students declare AI use. Another significant finding is the emphasis on fostering critical thinking skills to enable students to engage ethically with AI tools. The study recommends that higher education institutions train lecturers and students on ethical AI use, promote transparency in AI-assisted academic work, and invest in technologies that support these objectives. Revising assessment strategies to incorporate innovative, controlled formats is also suggested to mitigate misuse, ensuring the responsible integration of AI into educational practices.

AB  - Background: This study explored the factors that influence the balance between academic integrity and the effective use of GenAI tools in higher education. It focused on the role of institutional guidelines in enhancing the responsible use of GenAI technologies to enhance academic integrity. Objectives: The study was theoretically grounded in the Technology Acceptance Model and the Theory of Planned Behaviour to investigate the factors that promote academic integrity in using GenAI tools (RQ1), their impact and institutional strategies to effectively mitigate ethical risks (RQ2) and the model practices to support the ethical and effective use in higher education (RQ3). Methods: The PRISMA framework was used to systematically review and thematically synthesise the results of 213 peer-reviewed articles published between January 2021 and May 2025. Results: Finding indicates that academic support, defined by structured training, technical scaffolding, and perceived usefulness, is critical to enabling ethical GenAI use. Additionally, student self-regulation, as influenced by behavioural control and goal setting, was associated with greater academic integrity in GenAI-mediated learning. Whereas institutional policies varied widely, those with transparent, adaptive and discipline-responsive governance frameworks more effectively mitigated academic misconduct. Indeed, the model practices included GenAI ethics committees, interactive GenAI literacy modules, and the developer-educator collaborations to promote algorithmic transparency. Conclusions: A comprehensive systems-based approach that encompasses academic support, self-regulation and ethical guidelines is critical for the responsible use of GenAI tools in education. Hence, to preserve academic integrity while nurturing innovation, institutions should integrate GenAI ethics into curricular design, faculty development and cross-sectoral policy frameworks. Future research may expand into multilingual and longitudinal analyses to support equitable and sustainable GenAI integration across diverse educational settings.

AB  - To date, many AI initiatives (eg, AI4K12, CS for All) developed standards and frameworks as guidance for educators to create accessible and engaging Artificial Intelligence (AI) learning experiences for K-12 students. These efforts revealed a significant need to prepare youth to gain a fundamental understanding of how intelligence is created, applied, and its potential to perpetuate bias and unfairness. This study contributes to the growing interest in K-12 AI education by examining student learning of modelling real-world text data. Four students from an Advanced Placement computer science classroom at a public high school participated in this study. Our qualitative analysis reveals that the students developed nuanced and in-depth understandings of how text classification models--a type of AI application--are trained. Specifically, we found that in modelling texts, students: (1) drew on their social experiences and cultural knowledge to create predictive features, (2) engineered predictive features to address model errors, (3) described model learning patterns from training data and (4) reasoned about noisy features when comparing models. This study contributes to an initial understanding of student learning of modelling unstructured data and offers implications for scaffolding in-depth reasoning about model decision making.

AB  - This study compares how the generative AI (GenAI) large language model (LLM) ChatGPT performs in grading university exams compared to human teachers. Aspects investigated include consistency, large discrepancies and length of answer. Implications for higher education, including the role of teachers and ethics, are also discussed. Three Master's-level exams were scored using ChatGPT 3.5, and the results were compared with the teachers' scoring and the grading teachers were interviewed. In total, 463 exam responses were graded. With each response being graded at least three times, a total of 1389 gradings were conducted. For the final exam scores, 70% of ChatGPT's gradings were within 10% of the teachers' gradings and 31% within 5%. ChatGPT tended to give marginally higher scores. The agreement on grades is 30%, but 45% of the exams received an adjacent grade. On individual questions, ChatGPT is more inclined to avoid very high or very low scores. ChatGPT struggles to correctly score questions closely related to the course lectures but performs better on more general questions. The AI can generate plausible scores on university exams that, at first glance, look similar to a human grader. There are differences but it is not unlikely that two different human graders could result in similar discrepancies. During the interviews, teachers expressed their surprise at how well ChatGPT's grading matched their own. Increased use of AI can lead to ethical challenges as exams are entrusted to a machine whose decision-making criteria are not fully understood, especially concerning potential bias in training data.

AB  - The current article used real data to demonstrate the analysis and synthesis of Mixed Methods Research (MMR) data with generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI). I explore how reliable and valid Gen AI data outputs are and how to improve their use. The current content is geared towards enhancing methodological application regardless of field or discipline and includes access to a prompt library and examples of using outputs. The demonstration data used emanated from a study done in South Africa, with a quantitative sample size of 969 first-year engineering students and, for the qualitative part, 14 first-year students. In the current article, I compare my original analysis to ChatGPT results. Generative AI as a mind tool is best used with human insight, and I found this to be especially true when coding qualitative data. ChatGPT produced generic codes if asked to do inductive coding, and the results improved when training the Gen AI on human examples, which led to moderate and significant correlations between human and machine coding. The quantitative analysis was accurate for the descriptive statistics, but the researcher had to use best judgment to select the correct inferential analysis. Quantitative and qualitative analysis should be conducted separately in generative AI before asking the Chatbot for help with mixed methods results. In the current paper, I give guidelines and a tutorial on how to use chatbots in an ethically responsible and scientifically sound manner for research in social and human sciences.

AB  - Background/Purpose: Technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) emphasizes the effective integration of artificial intelligence (AI)-based tools in education, where specific knowledge is measured individually. This research determines the readiness of preservice teachers (PSTs) to integrate AI-based tools in education through the TPACK approach. Materials/Methods: This descriptive study involves 429 PSTs from Don Mariano Marcos Memorial State University in the Philippines through a face-to-face survey. Exploratory factor analysis was employed using a minimum residual extraction method with oblimin rotation. Partial least squares structural equation modeling was performed, and goodness of fit indices (GFI, AGFI, PGFI, RMSEA, and TLI) were tested. Results: The PSTs' readiness to integrate AI-based tools in education revealed their readiness based on their technical knowledge (TK), technical pedagogical knowledge (TPK), technical content knowledge (TCK), and TPACK, as well as their ethical readiness. The study found that the PSTs' TK, TPK, TCK, and TPACK were positively related to their ethical readiness. Conclusion: When PSTs enhance their technological competencies, their ethical considerations in the use of AI tools also improve. Relationships between TK, TPK, TCK, TPACK, and ethical readiness emphasize the need for teacher training approaches that nurture not just technical abilities, but also students' ethical consciousness. This highlights the interconnectedness of these knowledge frameworks in fostering effective and responsible technology integration in education.

AB  - Artificial intelligence has evolved since its inception in the 1950s, resulting in the creation of large language models that are trained on extensive data sets to understand and generate content, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, which launched in November 2022. Modern technology that is easy to access and free to use, like ChatGPT, is changing the educational landscape as it is an example of a large language model -- an artificial intelligence network -- that can process and generate text that reads as though it were written by a person. Using a survey and semi-structured interviews, this exploratory mixed-method study examined social work educators' experiences of addressing students' use of ChatGPT and found that although they are uncomfortable with addressing ChatGPT use with their students, they believe it is necessary to communicate its ethical use to them. Results also suggested that while using ChatGPT as a learning tool is valid, it can be overused. ChatGPT use gives students a false sense of having mastered academic material, and institutional guidelines are needed to address concerns regarding academic integrity and plagiarism. Moreover, instructors should address students' use of ChatGPT with their institutions and take intentional steps to ethically and creatively integrate artificial intelligence models into the social work curriculum.
